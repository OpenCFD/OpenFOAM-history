- NOT WORKING: fvMeshDistribute to split cyclic patches into ones
  with different separation.

  Different tag?

- fvMeshSubset
- kivaToFoam/readKivaGrid.H sorts cyclics (but in incorrect order?)
- grep for size()/2
- pointEdgeWave (maybe test through inversePointDistanceDiffusivity?)
- scotchDecomp

- renumberMesh
- work out scheduled communication?
