- initTransfer in GAMGprocessorInterfaces using nonblocking+tags
untested.

OK - cyclic baffles.
Tested on t-junction-with-fan

OK. - jumpCyclics/fanFvPatchField. All usages of jump() now need to account
for being owner() or not.

OK - pointEdgeWave (maybe test through inversePointDistanceDiffusivity?)

OK - scotchDecomp
tested with testCalcCSR on twoCavityCyclicForWallDistance

NOT WORKING - fvMeshDistribute to split cyclic patches into ones
  with different separation.
tested on singleCyclic

OK - test createPatch pointSync
note: only works if face-centre position of 0th faces is ok since uses
this for separation. Should in fact make cyclic planar using patch centre and
normal?
test on twoCavityCyclicForWallDistance with point (0 1 0) set to (0 1.001 0)

NO PROBLEM - renumberMesh
It doesn't do renumbering through cyclics.

OK - rotational cyclics.
Tested on movingCone-with-cyclics

OK - LUscalarMatrix::convert still expects interfaces to be cyclic
