  Different tag?
- fvMeshDistribute to split processor patches into ones with different
separation.
- fvMeshSubset
- kivaToFoam/readKivaGrid.H sorts cyclics (but in incorrect order?)
- grep for size()/2
- pointEdgeWave (maybe test through inversePointDistanceDiffusivity?)
- regionSplit
- scotchDecomp
- isoSurface.C
- referredCellList.C
- renumberMesh
- work out scheduled communication?
