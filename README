  A.  Running OpenFOAM in 32-bit mode


2. System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  OpenFOAM is developed and tested on Linux, but should work with other
  Unix style system.  To check your system setup, execute the foamSystemCheck
  script in the bin directory of the OpenFOAM installation. If no problems
  are reported, proceed to "3. Installation"; otherwise contact your
  system administrator.

  If the user wishes to run OpenFOAM in 32/64-bit mode they should consult
  the appendix "A. Running OpenFOAM in 32-bit mode".


3. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Download and unpack the files in the $HOME/OpenFOAM directory as described
  in:  http://www.OpenFOAM.org/download.html

  The environment variable settings are contained in files in an etc/
  directory in the OpenFOAM release. e.g. in

      $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/

      where <VERSION> corresponds to the version 1.4, 1.5, ...

  a)
    EITHER, if running bash or ksh (if in doubt type 'echo $SHELL'),
    source the etc/bashrc file by adding the following line to the end
    of your $HOME/.bashrc file:

        . $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc

    Then update the environment variables by sourcing the $HOME/.bashrc file
    by typing in the terminal:

        . $HOME/.bashrc

  b)
    OR, if running tcsh or csh, source the etc/cshrc file by adding the
    following line to the end of your $HOME/.cshrc file:

        source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/cshrc

    Then update the environment variables by sourcing the $HOME/.cshrc file
    by typing in the terminal:

        source $HOME/.cshrc


  3.1. Installation in alternative locations
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    OpenFOAM may also be installed in an alternative location.
    However, the installation directory must be network available
    (eg, NFS) if parallel calculations are planned.

    The environment variable 'FOAM_INST_DIR' can be used to find and source
    the appropriate resource file. Here is a bash/ksh/sh example:

        export FOAM_INST_DIR=/data/app/OpenFOAM
        foamDotFile=$FOAM_INST_DIR/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
        [ -f $foamDotFile ] && . $foamDotFile

    and a csh example:

        setenv FOAM_INST_DIR /data/app/OpenFOAM
        foamDotFile=$FOAM_INST_DIR/OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
        if ( -f $foamDotFile ) source $foamDotFile


    The value set in '$FOAM_INST_DIR' will be used to locate the remaining
    parts of the OpenFOAM installation.


4. Building from Sources (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you cannot find an appropriate binary pack for your platform, you can
  build the complete OpenFOAM from the source-pack.  First you will need to
  compile or obtain a recent version of gcc (we recomend gcc-4.2.?) for
  your platform, which may be obtained from http://gcc.gnu.org/.

  Install the compiler in
  $WM_PROJECT_INST_DIR/ThirdParty/gcc-<GCC_VERSION>/platforms/$WM_ARCH$WM_COMPILER_ARCH/
  and change the gcc version number in $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/settings.sh and
  $WM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/settings.csh appropriately and finally update the
  environment variables as in section 3.

  Now go to the top-level source directory $WM_PROJECT_DIR and type
  ./Allwmake, which is the name of the top-level build script for building
  the whole of OpenFOAM.  In principle this will build everything, but
  sometimes problems occur with the build order and it is necessary to
  update the environment variables and re-execute Allwmake.  If you
  experience difficulties with building the source-pack or your platform is
  not currently supported please contact <enquiries@OpenCFD.co.uk> to
  negotiate a support contract and we will do the port and maintain it in
  future releases.


5. Testing the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To check your installation setup, execute the 'foamInstallationTest'
  script (in the bin directory of the OpenFOAM installation). If no problems
  are reported, proceed to getting started with OpenFOAM; otherwise, go back
  and check you have installed the software correctly and/or contact your
  system administrator.


6. Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Create a project directory within the $HOME/OpenFOAM directory named
  <USER>-<VERSION> (e.g. 'chris-1.5' for user chris and OpenFOAM version 1.5)
  and create a directory named 'run' within it, e.g. by typing:

      mkdir -p $HOME/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${WM_PROJECT_VERSION}/run

  Copy the 'tutorial' examples directory in the OpenFOAM distribution to the
  'run' directory.  If OpenFOAM environment variables are set correctly,
  then the following command will be correct:

      cp -r $WM_PROJECT_DIR/tutorials $HOME/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${WM_PROJECT_VERSION}/run

  Run the first example case of incompressible laminar flow in a cavity:

      cd $HOME/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${WM_PROJECT_VERSION}/run/tutorials/icoFoam/cavity
      blockMesh
      icoFoam

A. Running OpenFOAM in 32-bit mode on 64-bit machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Those users with an installation of Linux on a 64-bit machine may install
  either or both of the 32-bit version of OpenFOAM (linux) or the 64-bit
  version of FOAM (linux64) with 64-bit being the default mode. In order to
  set up the user to run in 32-bit mode, the user must set the environment
  variable $WM_32 (to anything, e.g. "on") before sourcing the etc/bashrc
  (or etc/cshrc) file.  Unsetting $WM_32 and sourcing the bashrc file will
  set up the user to run in 64-bit mode.
