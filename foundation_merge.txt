    fvcSurfaceIntegrate: add support for sub-cycling with mesh-motion
    Resolves bug-report http://www.openfoam.org/mantisbt/view.php?id=1471
    
    Note:
        In order to avoid unexpectedly poor results I think it would be
        better if sub-cycling in time were limited to static meshes and
        solid-body motion only and the Vsc() function removed and I will
        consider this for the next release with the addition of a check for
        solid-body motion in the case that sub-cycling is applied.  Now that
        MULES support semi-implicit operation there is less need for
        sub-cycling and I would recommend that you use this approach in
        interDyMFoam for your complex mesh motion cases.

    Added and verified support for 64bit labels
    
    To compile with 64bit labels set
    
    WM_LABEL_SIZE=64
    
    in ~/OpenFOAM/dev/prefs.sh
    
    source ~/.bashrc
    
    then Allwmake in OpenFOAM-dev.
    
    This will build into for example OpenFOAM-dev/platforms/linux64ClangDPInt64Opt
    
    If WM_LABEL_SIZE is unset or set to 32:
    
    WM_LABEL_SIZE=32
    
    the build would be placed into OpenFOAM-dev/platforms/linux64ClangDPInt32Opt
    
    Thus both 32bit and 64bit label builds can coexist without problem.
