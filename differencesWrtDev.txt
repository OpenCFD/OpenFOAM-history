mesh/conformalVoronoiMesh
    - all the meshing. See separate section below.

polyMeshGeometry:
    - disabled tetquality check on face-center decomp tet.
      Check only minTetDecomp tet.

      limits face filtering if enabled. So cv3d can generate neg.
      (face-centre decomp) tets but pyramid volumes are still positive!

indexedOctree:
    - findSphere routine

closedTriSurfaceMesh :
    triSurface which is defined closed even though topologically it isn't.

searchableSurface  :
    - bounds_ member data
    - bool overlaps() const routine
searchableSurfaces, searhcableSurfacesQueries  :
    - findNearestIntersection routine
    - bounds routines

surfaceFeatures:
    - trimFeatures function returns trimmed bits

triSurfaceTools:
    - surfaceSide.

    the edge code is irrelevant. Use dev bits.
    
indexedOctree:
    - findSphere

polyMeshTetDecomposition:
    - disabled face-centre tet quality check (but kept minTetDecomp)

polyMesh.C:
    - read cell centres if present.

    Can be scrapped. Not useful. Does not write cell centres, does not
    do decomposition, reconstruction, moving meshes.

primitiveMesh:
    - overrideCellCentres

triangleI.H:
    - stabilised triangle quality. Ok.

memInfo:
    - added I/O operators. Useful.

distributedTrisurfaceMesh:
    - additional reduce on boundBox. Can be removed only on the one
    constructed from boundBox (line 2300)


Utilities/

cvMesh:
    - top level mesher

checkMesh:
    - override cellCentres. Remove if the polyMesh stuff gets removed.

surfaceCheck:
    - moved triSurface quality into triangle. Use cvm.

surfaceBooleanFeatures:
    - new application. Determines features straight from intersection.
    More stable than surfaceBooleanOp. Used to e.g. get the features
    between the wheels and wind tunnel.
    So if surfaceBooleanOp fails:
    - use this to extract features
    - use snappyHexMesh to defeature
    - use cvMesh with extracted features
    This does not work very well! Since there might still be overlapping
    bits of triSurface that will be meshed.
 
surfaceFeatureExtract:
    - uses cgal only for curvature calculation. See cgal.
    - writes a triSurfaceField of 'curvature' and 'internal closeness'
    and 'external closeness'. This is just a normal intersection, not
    a nearest point. These fields get used by cvMesh. Or not yet - is part
    of proposal to seed points according to curvature.
    - detects features that are near?

surfaceSplitByTopology:
    - for fuel tank of Brawn. Detects baffles (markZones) and splits
    it accordingly.



conformalVoronoiMesh/
--------------------
- Make sure the surface does not have any sliver triangles. These are
hard to get the surface normal correct for so might cause bleeding.
- Use surfaceCheck to find out triangle quality and size of smallest edges
- Use surfaceClean .. 1e-5 .. to get rid of any edges < 1e-5m.

- If you get bleeding you might see in face filtering:

    ...
    cells with with zero or one non-boundary face          : 1
    ...
    Initial check before face collapse, found 48 bad quality faces

but this was real - the cell that got created inside the cone and sphere by the 
bad triangle was actually attached to a lot of faces.  This screwed up the 
subsequent filtering as it stopped too early.

I ran:

    surfaceClean coneAndSphere.obj 1e-5 coneAndSphere_clean.obj

and re-ran with that surface and got

    ...
    cells with with zero or one non-boundary face          : 0
    ...
    Initial check before face collapse, found 0 bad quality faces

and the bad cells inside are gone.

That group of cells would be picked up at the end of the meshing as the

    cvMesh_remainingProtrusions

cellSet which can be deleted.
