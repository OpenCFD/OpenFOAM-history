polyMeshGeometry:
    - disabled tetquality check on face-center decomp tet.
      Check only minTetDecomp tet.

indexedOctree:
    - findSphere routine

closedTriSurfaceMesh :
    triSurface which is defined closed even though topologically it isn't.

searchableSurface  :
    - bounds_ member data
    - bool overlaps() const routine
searchableSurfaces, searhcableSurfacesQueries  :
    - findNearestIntersection routine

surfaceFeatures:
    - trimFeatures function returns trimmed bits

triSurfaceTools:
    - surfaceSide

indexedOctree:
    - findSphere

polyMeshTetDecomposition:
    - disabled face-centre tet quality check (but kept minTetDecomp)

polyMesh.C:
    - read cell centres if present

primitiveMesh:
    - overrideCellCentres

triangleI.H:
    - stabilised triangle quality

memInfo:
    - added I/O operators

distributedTrisurfaceMesh:
    - additional reduce on boundBox?
