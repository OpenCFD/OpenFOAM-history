* Overview
  OpenFOAM-dev is the latest major release of OpenFOAM including many new
  developments a number of bug-fixes.  This release passes our standard tests
  and the tutorials have been broadly checked.  Please report any bugs by
  following the link: http://www.openfoam.com/bugs.

* GNU/Linux version
  This release of OpenFOAM is distributed primarily in 2 ways: (1) as a Debian
  pack containing binaries and source; (2) from the SourceForge source code
  repository (see [[./README.org][README]]).

  The Ubuntu/Debian pack is available for 32 and 64 bit versions of the 10.04
  LTS operating system using the system compiler and libraries that will be
  installed automatically from standard Debian packs.

  To use the source version from the SourceForge repository, we provide a source
  pack of third-party packages that can be compiled on the user's system.  This
  does not include =gcc=, since the system installed version is typically
  sufficient, but includes =paraview-3.8.0=, =openmpi-1.4.1=, =scotch_5.1=,
  =metis-5.0pre2=, =ParMetis-3.1= and =ParMGridGen-1.0=.

* Library developments

  There have been a number of developments to the libraries to support the
  extension of functionality in solver and utility applications.
*** Core library
    + Large number of code refinements and consistency improvements to support
      other developments.
    + Parallel : using non-blocking communications wherever possible. This will
      lead to lower requirements for MPI_BUFFER_SIZE and possibly better
      start-up performance on larger numbers of processors.
*** Turbulence modelling
*** *Updated* thermophysical libraries
    + Now use the more descriptive dictionary input format, e.g. for a single
      component mixture:
      #+BEGIN_SRC c++
      thermoType      hPsiThermo<pureMixture<sutherlandTransport<specieThermo<hConstThermo<perfectGas>>>>>;

      mixture
      {
          nMoles      1;
          molWeight   28.9;
          Cp          1007;
          Hf          0;
          As          1.4792e-06;
          Ts          116;
      }
      #+END_SRC
*** Lagrangian intermediate library
    + Extensively updated
    + *Updated* input format
    + Extended to include steady cloud tracking
    + *New* collision modelling
    + *Coupled* to new surface film modelling library
    + *New* sub-models
      + NonSphereDrag: drag model to account for non-spherical particles
      + ParticleTracks: post-processing model to generate track data, typically
        during steady calculations
    + *Updated* sub-models
      + Devolatilisation models: now act on a per-specie basis

*** DSMC
*** Dynamic Mesh
*** Numerics
*** *Updated* command line help, e.g. `snappyHexMesh -help' now gives:
    #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    Usage: snappyHexMesh [OPTIONS]
    options:
      -case <dir>       specify alternate case directory, default is the cwd
      -overwrite        overwrite existing mesh/results files
      -parallel         run in parallel
      -srcDoc           display source code in browser
      -doc              display application documentation in browser
      -help             print the usage
    #+END_SRC
*** *New* basicSolidThermo solids thermophysical library
    + Used in all conjugate heat transfer solvers
      + constant properties
      + temperature dependent properties
      + temperature and direction (in local coordinate system) dependent
        properties
*** *New* Surface film library
    + Creation of films by particle addition, or initial film distribution
    + Coupled with the lagrangian/intermediate cloud hierarchy library
    + Hierarchical design, consisting of
      + kinematic film: mass, momentum
        + constant thermodynamic properties
      + thermodynamic film: mass, momentum and enthalpy
        + constant, or temperature dependant thermodynamic properties
    + Sub-models:
      + detachment/dripping whereby particles (re)enter the originating cloud
        + particle sizes set according to PDF
        + other properties set to ensure mass, momentum and energy conservation
      + heat transfer to/from walls and film surface
      + film evaporation and boiling
    + Additional wall functions for primary region momentum and temperature
      taking film into account
    + Parallel aware
*** *New* ptscotch decomposition method
*** *Updated* scotch decomposition method to run in parallel by doing
    decomposition on the master. Unfortunately scotch and ptscotch cannot
    be linked in to the same executable.
*** *Updated* simple decomposition method to run in parallel by doing
    decomposition on the master.
*** *Updated* decomposePar maps polyPatches instead of recreating them so
    polyPatches holding data can map the data.
*** *Updated* particle tracking algorithm
    + uses non-blocking parallel transfers
    + does 'minimum-tet' decomposition of face to work with warped faces
      (snappyHexMesh!)
    + reuses tracking state in interpolation - improves consistency and speed
*** *Updated* split cyclics into two separate patches.
    See [[./doc/changes/splitCyclic.txt]]
  * *Updated* interpolation (volPointInterpolation) now works without the
    globalPointPatch. Moving mesh cases can now be run non-parallel and
    continued in parallel and reconstructed without any limitation.
*** *New* compact binary I/O for faces and cells.
    This speeds up reading/writing meshes in binary.
*** *Updated* runTimeModifiable
    + user selectable model to use for checking run-time modifiable
      dictionaries (see also doc/changes/inotify.txt):
      + timeStamp : use time stamp as before
      + inotify : use inotify instead of time stamp
      + timeStampMaster : only master checks and reads file. Slaves get file
        contents from master.
      + inotifyMaster : only master checks and reads file. Slaves get file
        contents from master.
    + on linux optionally uses inotify instead of time stamps - more efficient
      for large numbers of monitored files. No more fileModificationSkew needed.
    + single integer reduction instead of one reduction per monitored file.
    + only files that can be re-read are being checked. Drastic reduction of
      number of files to check.
*** *New* #codeStream dictionary entry
    Uses dynamic compilation of OpenFOAM C++ code to construct dictionary.
    E.g. in blockMeshDict:
    #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    convertToMeters 0.001;

    vertices #codeStream
    {
        code
        #{
            label nVerts =
                readLabel(dict.lookup("nx"))
               *readLabel(dict.lookup("ny"))
               *readLabel(dict.lookup("nz"));
            pointField verts(nVerts);
            // Now fill verts here
            // ..
            os  << verts;
        #};
    }
    #+END_SRC

* Solvers
  A number of new solvers have been developed for a range of engineering
  applications.  There has been a set of improvements to certain classes of
  solver that are introduced in this release.
*** *New* Solvers
    + =reactingParcelFilmFoam=: Lagrangian cloud and film transport in a
      reacting gas phase system
    + =steadyReactingParcelFoam=: Steady solution of cloud and reacting systems
      using local time stepping methods
*** Modifications to multiphase and buoyant solvers
    + ...
*** Modifications to solvers for sensible enthalpy
    + ...
*** Modifications to steady-state compressible solvers
    + ...
*** Other modifications
    + ...

* Boundary conditions
  New boundary conditions have been introduced to support new applications in
  OpenFOAM.
  + *New* wall functions:
    + kappatJayatillekeWallFunction: incompressible RAS thermal wall function
  + directMappedFixedValue:
    + takes interpolationScheme so can interpolate instead of always getting
      cell value
    + takes optional fieldName to sample
    + directMapped patch added 'normal' method to calculate sample points
      to e.g. sample fields just above wall (e.g. for streaklines)
  + *New* codedFixedValue: Uses the dynamic code compilation from #codeStream
    to provide an in-line fixedValueFvPatchScalarField. E.g.
    #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    outlet
    {
        type            codedFixedValue;
        value           uniform 0;
        redirectType    ramped;

        code
        #{
            operator==(min(10, 0.1*this->db().time().value()));
        #};
    }
    #+END_SRC
    See also [[./doc/changes/dynamicCode.org]]

* Utilities
  There have been some utilities added and updated in this release.
*** *New* utilities
    + =extrudeToRegionMesh=: Extrude faceZones into separate mesh (as a
      different region)
      + used to e.g. extrude baffles (extrude internal faces) or create
        liquid film regions
      + if extruding internal faces:
         + create baffles in original mesh with directMappedWall patches
      + if extruding boundary faces:
        + convert boundary faces to directMappedWall patches
      + extrude edges of faceZone as a <zone>_sidePatch
      + extrude edges inbetween different faceZones as a
        (nonuniformTransform)cyclic <zoneA>_<zoneB>
      + extrudes into master direction (i.e. away from the owner cell
        if flipMap is false)
    + =topoSet=: replacement of cellSet,faceSet,pointSet utilities.
      Comparable to a dictionary driven =setSet= utility.
*** Updated utilities
    + =setFields=: optionally use faceSets to set patch values (see
      e.g. =hotRoom= tutorial).
    + =blockMesh=: specify patches via dictionary instead of type only. This
      makes rereading the boundary file superfluous. see
      e.g. pitzDailyDirectMapped tutorial.
    + =setSet=: allows time range (e.g. 0:100) in combination with -batch
    argument to execute the commands for multiple times.
    + =extrudeMesh=:
      - option to add extrusion to existing mesh.
      - works in parallel
    + =snappyHexMesh=:
      + extrude across multi-processor boundaries
      + preserve faceZones during layering
      + *Warning*:
            - minMedianAxisAngle angle fixed w.r.t. 17x. Set to
              90 to get same behaviour as 130 in 17x.
            - nGrow did not work in 17x. Set to 0
              to get same behaviour as 130 in 17x.
            - new minTetQuality setting (see tracking). Disable for 17x
              compatibility.
* Post-processing
  + =paraFoam=, =foamToVTK=: full support for polyhedral cell type in recent
     Paraview versions.
  + =foamToEnsight=: parallel continuous data. new =-nodeValues= option to
    generate and output nodal field data.
  + =singleCellMesh=: new utility to convert mesh and fields to a single cell
    mesh. Great for postprocessing.
  + =steadyParticleTracks=: Generates VTK tracks from the output of the cloud
    =ParticleTracks= post-processing sub-model
  + Sampling:
    + =patchInternalField=: new sampledSurface - like 'patch' but samples
    internal field instead of boundary field.
    + =ensight=: new output format for all sampledSurfaces.
  + Function objects:
    + =residualControl=: new function object to allow users to terminate steady
    state calculations when the defined residual levels are achieved
    + =abortCalculation=: watches for presence of the named file in the
    $FOAM_CASE directory and aborts the calculation if it is present
    + =timeActivatedFileUpdate=: performs a file copy/replacement once a
    specified time has been reached, e.g. to automagically change fvSchemes and
    fvSolution during a calculation
    + =streamLine=: generate streamlines; ouputs both trajectory and field data
    + =surfaceInterpolateFields=: constructs face interpolate of registered
       volFields for any future functionObjects that need surfaceFields.
    + =readFields=: reads field if not yet registered. Makes functionObjects
      useable through standalone execFlowFunctionObjects.
    + =faceSource=: can now calculate on a sampledSurface (e.g. flow through a
       triSurfaceMesh).
    + =nearWallFields=: constructs field with on selected patches interpolated
       internal field for further postprocessing.
    + =coded=: uses the dynamic code compilation from =#codeStream=
    to provide an in-line functionObject. E.g.
    #+BEGIN_SRC c++
    functions
    {
        pAverage
        {
            functionObjectLibs ("libutilityFunctionObjects.so");
            type coded;
            redirectType average;
            code
            #{
                const volScalarField& p = mesh().lookupObject<volScalarField>("p");
                Info<<"p avg:" << average(p) << endl;
            #};
        }
    }
    #+END_SRC
    See also [[./doc/changes/dynamicCode.org]]


* New tutorials
  There is a large number of new tutorials for existing and new solvers in the
  release.
  + =reactingParcelFilmFoam= tutorials:
    + multipleBoxes, hotBoxes, panel, evaporationTest
  + =interDyMFoam= tutorials:
    + testTubeMixer: showcases =solidBodyMotionFunction=

* Other
  + compilable with =clang=
    In your prefs.sh set the WM_COMPILER to Clang
  + dlclose error: upon exit of e.g. paraFoam you can get the error
    Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-close.c: 731: _dl_close: Assertion
    `map->l_init_called' failed!
    This seems to happen with a mix of system libraries and a thirdParty
    compiler.
