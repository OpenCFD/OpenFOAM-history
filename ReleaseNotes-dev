* Overview
  OpenFOAM-dev is the latest major release of OpenFOAM including many new
  developments a number of bug-fixes.  This release passes our standard tests
  and the tutorials have been broadly checked.  Please report any bugs by
  following the link: http://www.openfoam.com/bugs.

* GNU/Linux version
  This release of OpenFOAM is distributed primarily in 2 ways: (1) as a Debian
  pack containing binaries and source; (2) from the SourceForge source code
  repository (see [[./README.org][README]]).

  The Ubuntu/Debian pack is available for 32 and 64 bit versions of the 10.04
  LTS operating system using the system compiler and libraries that will be
  installed automatically from standard Debian packs.

  To use the source version from the SourceForge repository, we provide a source
  pack of third-party packages that can be compiled on the user's system.  This
  does not include =gcc=, since the system installed version is typically
  sufficient, but includes =paraview-3.8.0=, =openmpi-1.4.1=, =scotch_5.1=,
  =metis-5.0pre2=, =ParMetis-3.1= and =ParMGridGen-1.0=.

* Library developments
  There have been a number of developments to the libraries to support the
  extension of functionality in solver and utility applications.
*** Core library
    + Large number of code refinements and consistency improvements to support
      other developments.
*** Turbulence modelling
*** Thermo-physical Models
*** DSMC

*** Numerics

* Solvers
  A number of new solvers have been developed for a range of engineering
  applications.  There has been a set of improvements to certain classes of
  solver that are introduced in this release.
