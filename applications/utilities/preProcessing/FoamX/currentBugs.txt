Bugs
----

1]
(startup)
The C++ codes read the ns.ref file as well as the Java.
They should contact nsd directly. 04/02/03: C++ codes use commandline arguments
passed through.

2]
(startup)
- also if roots are incorrect and cannot be read) you get no warning.
8/1/02: partially fixed: is warning message from FoamXCaseBrowser
--> FOAM Warning : User specified root directory '"/aaaa/run/LES"' not found.
Removing from root directories list.

3]
(startup)
If licenseserver gets killed and restarted foamX gets confused.
Unclear message. Should it be possible to reconnect (by rereading ns.ref?).

4]
(case opening)
if mesh&fields are not consistent (changing number of patches)
you get exception:
FoamXError:
Type mismatch, expected scalar, got invalidType
in function FoamX::FoamXAny::SetValue(const FoamXServer::FoamXAny&)
in file FoamXAny.C at line 87
CANNOT REPRODUCE. 04/02/03. Adding patch to 'boundaryField' is no problem
(not used). Deleting patch info from 'boundaryField' just makes it use default
values.

5]
(create case)
Application class is straight pull down instead of now hierarchical.

6]
(dictionary editor)
Timeformat is Optional but
- if they don't have it, it is scientific
- if they do have it, it is general.

7]
(import mesh)
If import is meshDescription only FoamX pops up box: "no mesh defined"
Yes? What is the problem?

8]
no possibility of hand editing arguments. E.g. parallel running?

9]
parallel running tool

10]
Logs/Probes:
- text tail log (should wait until log appears. Sleep is done on Java side)
- text view log
- graph tail var in log
- graph view var in log
- graph tail probe
- graph view probe

11]
(process editor)
On slow machine Corba can timeout (e.g. running foamProcessInfo on turner)
leaving it in bad state.
Ok if timeOut set to larger value.

12]
(run panel)
Run a case (e.g. icoFoam) in foreground. Kill icoFoam process. 
Upsets Corba and FoamX does not work anymore.
CANNOT REPRODUCE. 4/02/03. It pops up panel saying 'icoFoam exited with
return code 15'

13]
Cannot resolve URL from /FoamX/icons/small/maths/interpolationScheme.gif
Cannot resolve URL from /FoamX/icons/small/maths/snGradScheme.gif

14]
in caseChooserDlg you are allowed to 'Open Case Browser'.
Is not supported internally.

15]
No possibility of rereading dictionaries. But is supported for mesh & fields.

16]
caseBrowser tree does not get refreshed sometimes if case gets closed.

17]
If clone case fails the case list gets messed up. Unlock-case should remove
any case from caseList in caseBrowser.

18]
Chris: for his tutorials: no boundary file. When opening case and then saving
it overwrites fields with ones without all the carefully set boundary info.

19]
Start with arguments to open case automatically:
runFoamX penfold $FOAM_RUN/icoFoam cavityTut
Now in caseBrower busyCursor is still on.
10/04/03. REMOVED busy cursor from openCase

20]
View Log file. - Followmode does not work.

21]
(simpleEditor)
Does not have key shortcuts.


**** APPEARANCE ***************************************************************

22]
Close button does not close all dictionary windows.
Open e.g. field (say U), open boundary condition window.
This (managed) window does not close.

23] 
(changes to button icons) 
Open/Close_Case_Broswer (they are the same as start/stop FOAM run)
perhaps a terminal for Open_Case_Browser 
Close_case (looks like stop run)

24] 
(case setup)
Tools are not accessible from the menu bar at the top of the screen.

25]
(case panel)
Icons for fields dont work (icons for dictionary entries do!)
(Chris)

26] (dictionary editor) 
Description of an individual entry in a dictionary in bottom panel of
toplevel dictionaryEditor appears only in dictionaryEditor, not in any of the
other editors.

27]
(case editor)
Nice to know which time is set in database so when you are editing fields
you know which one is being edited.

28] 
(menu bar)
When editing a case there should be File -> Save Case (and other options)
