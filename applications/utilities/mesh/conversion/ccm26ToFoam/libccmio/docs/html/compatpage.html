<h1><a name="compatpage">Backwards Compatibility</a>
</h1> As with all file formats, the CCM specification has undergone some changes in its history.&nbsp; Where possible, backwards compatibility has been included within the library itself.&nbsp; However, there have been a few hierarchical changes which the library cannot hide from the client.&nbsp; If backwards compatibility with these files is desired, the client will need to handle the case appropriately.&nbsp; These cases have been recorded below, along with sample code to handle it.&nbsp; The <a class="el" href="a00004.html">readexample.cpp</a> read example included contains appropriate handling for all cases.<br>
 <br>
 <h3>Addition of Phase Node (2.2.0)</h3>
 In version 2.2.0 it became necessary to support different material phases, each with their own sets of (possibly different) fields.&nbsp; The Phase entity was inserted between the FieldSet and the Field, so clients must be aware that there may be no Phase entity under FieldSet in older files.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Code:</b><br>
 <pre>
    ...
    bool oldFile = (CCMIONextEntity(NULL, solution, kCCMIOFieldPhase, &amp;i, &amp;phase) != kCCMIONoErr);
    i = 0;
    while (oldFile ||
           CCMIONextEntity(NULL, solution, kCCMIOFieldPhase, &amp;i, &amp;phase)== kCCMIONoErr)
    {
        if (oldFile)
            phase = solution;</pre> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... <em>read data</em> ...</code> <pre>        oldFile = false;
    }
    ...
</pre> <h3>Multidimensional data stored as scalar components (2.4.0)<br>
 </h3>
 Some clients noted that often multidimensional data (i.e. vector data) was needed one component at a time.&nbsp; Since this can reduce the memory needed to compute secondary quantities, an important consideration for large data, the file format was changed to store multidimensional data as components.&nbsp; Previously all field data was read using CCMIOReadFieldData*().&nbsp; With this change only scalar data can be read with CCMIOReadFieldData*() and all multidimensional data must be read with CCMIOReadMultiDimensionalFieldData*().&nbsp; (The extra function was added to be consistent with prefering extra functions to extra parameters)&nbsp; However, CCMIOReadFieldData*() is still required to read older data.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Code:</b><br>
 <pre>
    ...
    CCMIOReadField(&amp;err, field, name, shortName, &amp;dims, &amp;datatype);
    CCMIOEntitySize(&amp;err, fieldData, &amp;n, &amp;max);
    CCMIOReadMultiDimensionalFieldData(&amp;err, field, kCCMIOVectorX, scalarID);
    if (err == kCCMIOVersionErr)
        data.size(n * dims);
    else
        data.size(n);
    ...
    while (CCMIONextEntity(NULL, field, kCCMIOFieldData, &amp;j, &amp;fieldData) == kCCMIONoErr)
        ...
        CCMIOReadFieldDataf(...);
    ...
</pre>
