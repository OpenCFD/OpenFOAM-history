Fieldview9 reader module
------------------------
This is a version of the fvbin executable with a built-in reader for Foam
data.

1] Limitations
--------------
- only volScalarFields and volVectorFields and only on points, not on boundary.
- handles polyhedra by decomposition (introduces cell centre)
- no surface fields, no lagrangian fields, no tetFem fields.
- does not run in parallel

2] Building
-----------
It has only been tested on Linux. Other platforms should build with a little
bit of effort. Have a look at the Fieldview link script and see which options
you need to add to Make/options to make it build.

Instructions:
0. Make sure FV_HOME is set to the root of the FieldView installation.
(i.e. $FV_HOME/user should exist)

1. Add $FV_HOME/bin to your path and make sure you can actually run fv.

2. Make the new fv executable by typing

    wmake

   This should create an 'fvbinFoam' executable.

3. On Linux you can directly run this executable instead of through the 'fv'
script. On other machines you might have to backup the old $FV_HOME/bin/fvbin
executable and move the fvbinFoam one into its position. Now you can use the
fv script to start it all up.


3] Running
----------
After starting it up (see step above) you should have a 'Foam Reader' under
the 'Data Files' pull-down menu. This will open a file selection box. Go to the
case directory and click on any file. The reader will recognize that the
current directory is a case directory (it has checks for a 'constant' directory)
and start reading the mesh. It will
pop-up a box with time steps and a list of variables as usual.

In case of a case with topology changes (i.e. more than one mesh) it
will ask for the time step a second time. This is due to a limitation in
Fieldview. Choose the same time as before.

In the terminal window it will print various informational messages.

A not fairly well tested feature is cellSet displaying. Instead of selecting
a case directory selecting a cellSet (in a polyMesh/sets/ directory) it
will try to subset the mesh using the selected cellSet. It is not possible
to display fields on subsetted meshes.
