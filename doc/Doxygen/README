Building the Doxygen help for OpenFOAM
======================================

The HTML documentation of OpenFOAM can be built using the Doxygen
software.  Images in the documentation are generated using "dot", a
program within the graphviz software package.  To build the
documentation on the Ubuntu Linux system, for example, the user should
install both doxygen and graphviz packages, e.g. by typing in a
terminal window:

    sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

The Doxygen documentation will build automatically for a user that is
configured to run OpenFOAM, i.e. has environment variables such as
$WM_PROJECT_DIR set.  The user must also ensure they have write
permission for the directory that Doxygen writes files to.

The Doygen configuration file, Doxyfile, in the
$WM_PROJECT_DIR/doc/Doxygen directory is configured to work with
Doxygen versions 1.6.3-1.8.1.


**Note**:
    For versions of Doxygen below 1.7, the final <div> in the
    _Header file (line 37) must be deleted before running Doxygen to
    produce the correctly formatted HTML files.
