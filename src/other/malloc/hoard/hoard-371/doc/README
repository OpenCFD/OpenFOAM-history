This directory contains documentation on Hoard, and article on Heap
Layers and four technical papers describing Heap Layers and related
memory allocators.

The documentation on Hoard can be read by pointing your browser to
index.html.

The article, in heaplayers-article-cuj.htm, is from the C/C++ Users
Journal (www.cuj.com), by Andrei Alexandrescu (with some help from
Emery Berger). It's a good overview of Heap Layers.

The technical articles first describe a previous version of Hoard,
which has now been rewritten in terms of Heap Layers
(berger-asplos2000.pdf). The second (berger-pldi2001.pdf) presents the
Heap Layers framework itself along with some uniprocessor allocators
written using the framework, while the third (berger-oopsla2002.pdf)
presents an empirical study of custom memory allocators and "reaps", a
hybrid of regions of heaps. The fourth (feng-msp2005.pdf) presents a
locality-improving dynamic allocator called "Vam", built with Heap
Layers.

The following are BibTeX entries, included for citing convenience.
