    <title>Building Hoard</title> 
  </header>

<p>
You can use the available pre-built binaries or build Hoard
yourself. Hoard is written to work on Windows and any variant of UNIX
that supports threads, and should compile out of the box. Rather than
using Makefiles or configure scripts, Hoard includes custom scripts
that all start with the prefix compile.

<p>
You can compile Hoard out of the box for Linux and Solaris using the
GNU compilers (g++) just by running the compile
script:
</p>
 
<source>
./compile
</source>

  <section>
  <title>Windows Builds</title>
  <p>
There are two alternative ways of using Hoard with Windows.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
The first approach builds a DLL, libhoard.dll and
its associated library libhoard.lib.
</p>

<source>
.\compile-dll
</source>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The second and preferred approach generates winhoard, which replaces
malloc/new calls in your program and any DLLs it might use.
  </p>

<source>
.\compile-winhoard
</source>
  </li>
  </ol>
