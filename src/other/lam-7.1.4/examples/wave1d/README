wave1d is a simple example of SPMD grid parallel programming
technique, written in Fortran.  It runs with any number of processes,
up to the number of arbitrarily chosen grid points.  The I/O is not
sophisticated.  The inputs are hardcoded and the output is written
locally by each process.  The resulting wave.out files should be
concatenated in ascending process order to form the complete wave
data.

Use "make" to compile this example.  Make will use mpif77 to compile
the program.  You must have a Fortran compiler already installed:

       mpif77 -o wave wave.f

This application can be run on any number of nodes.  For example:

       mpirun C wave
