# Wave1d sample application schema

#
# Run any number of processes, but one per CPU is the most sensible
# thing.  Assuming the multicomputer is homogeneous, ship the
# executable to each node.  This is slower but more convenient than
# placing it there yourself or relying upon NFS and your shell path to
# be right.
#
# We specify the full pathname to the "master" executable so that it
# is sure to be found.  It may not be necessary to specify the full
# pathname in all cases; see mpirun(1) for more details.
#
# Any one line application schema can be done on the mpirun command line,
# without a schema file like this one.
