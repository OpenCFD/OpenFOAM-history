This simple program approximates the value of pi using different
numbers of integration points (from 2 to 1000).

Use make to compile these programs.  Make will use mpicc, mpic++, and
mpif77 to compile these programs:

       mpicc -o cpi cpi.c -lm
       mpic++ -o cxxpi cxxpi.cc -lm
       mpif77 -o fpi fpi.f -lm

These programs can be run with any number of MPI processes (including
1).  For example:

       mpirun C cpi
       mpirun C cxxpi
       mpirun C fpi
