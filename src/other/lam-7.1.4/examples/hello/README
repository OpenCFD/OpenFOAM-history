This simple program prints the canonical "Hello, world!" message for
each MPI process that is started.  The message indicates the MPI rank
number and total number of MPI processes in the job.

Use make to compile these programs.  Make will use mpicc to compile it:

       mpicc -o hello hello.c

This program can be run with any number of MPI processes (including
1).  For example:

       mpirun C hello
