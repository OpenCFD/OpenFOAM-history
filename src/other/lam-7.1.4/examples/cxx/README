$HEADER$



ring is a common example of an MPI program; it runs with any number of
processes, and sends a simple message sequentially through all the
processes, with the last process returning the message back to process
zero.  This message repeats the "ring" N times.

This example is taken directly from the MPI 2 C++ package
distribution; it is a simple C++ implementation of the standard "ring"
example program.  It uses the C++ MPI bindings to effect message
passing. 

Use "make" to compile this example.  Make will use mpiCC to compile
the program:

      mpiCC -o ring ring.cc

This program can be run with any number of MPI processes.  For
example:

      mpirun C ring
