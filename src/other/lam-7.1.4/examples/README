$HEADER$



These examples are meant to both be an introduction to MPI as well as
show how to compile LAM programs.  Note that the MPI 2 C++ and ROMIO
examples only use the "mpicc", "mpic++", and "mpif77" LAM wrapper
compilers -- no additional compiler flags are necessary, as the
wrapper compilers supply all needed information.

alltoall        -- shows an all-to-all communication pattern, only in C
fault           -- fault tolerant master/slave, only in C
hello           -- canonical "hello world" example program in parallel
mandelbrot      -- master/slave, only in C
mpi2c++         -- simple "ring" program in C++
                   Will only be valid if you compiled MPI 2 C++
                   bindings support into LAM.  See the INSTALL and
                   RELEASE_NOTES files.
pi              -- canonical programs to approximate pi, in both C and
                   Fortran. 
ring            -- canonical program that shows a ring communication
                   pattern, only in C
romio           -- simple ROMIO program in C
                   Will only be valid if you compiled ROMIO support
                   into LAM.  See the INSTALL and RELEASE_NOTES files.
trivial         -- simple send and receive message, C and F77
wave1d          -- crystalline programming, only in F77
