# Run the master on the node where lamboot was invoked so
# that stdout will be visible.  Change the printf() functions to tprintf(),
# to use LAM I/O and the master can run on any node (with the output
# again coming, by default, to the lamboot node).
#
# We specify the full pathname to the "master" executable so that it
# is sure to be found.  It may not be necessary to specify the full
# pathname in all cases; see mpirun(1) for more details.

# Run any number of slaves, but one per CPU is the most sensible thing.
# Assuming the multicomputer is homogeneous, ship the executable
# to each node.  This is slower but more convenient than placing it there
# yourself or relying upon NFS and your shell path to be right.
#
# We specify the full pathname to slave for the same reason as above.
