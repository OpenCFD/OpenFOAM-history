Mandelbrot is a simple example of the master/slave parallel
programming technique, written in C.  It runs with one master process
and any number of slaves.  The master writes the computed image into a
Sun rasterfile formatted file.  Try viewing it with X11/xv.

Use "make" to compile this examples.  Make will use mpicc to compile
both programs:

      mpicc -o master master.c
      mpicc -o slave slave.c

Since this application is MIMD, you can either run it with mpiexec, or
use the sample "myapp" application schema in this directory to run it
with mpirun.  For example:

      mpiexec h master : C -s h slave

or

      mpriun myapp

See the extensive comments in the "myapp" file in this directory for
more details, as well as the man pages for mpirun(1) and mpiexec(1).
