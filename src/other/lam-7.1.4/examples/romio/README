$HEADER$



simple is a fairly straightforward example of using the MPI I/O
functions.  Each process writes to separate files and then reads them
back.  The filename is given as a command line argument.  Each process
writes to this filename with their rank number appended to it.

This program was taken directly from the ROMIO distribution.  It will
compile properly if ROMIO support was compiled into LAM (which
typically happens by default, unless ROMIO support was explicitly
disabled with the --without-romio switch to ./configure.  Use the
"laminfo" command to see if ROMIO support is included in your LAM
installation).

Use "make" to compile this example.  Make will use mpicc to compile
this program.  LAM's "mpicc" takes care of linking in all the
appropriate libraries, etc.:

       mpicc -o simple simple.c

This program requires a sample filename to use as test storage.  You
can run it on any number of processors.  For example:

       mpirun C simple -fname <filename>

Where "<filename>" is the name of the file to use for storage.
