$HEADER$



trivial is a most basic message-passing program that transfers one
message between two processes.  Two versions are supplied: one in C
and the other in Fortran.

Use "make" to compile this example.  Make will use mpicc and mpif77 to
compile these programs:

        mpicc -o trivialc trivialc.c
        mpif77 -o trivialf trivialf.f

ezstart.c is a master/slave skeleton used in "MPI Primer / Developing
With LAM".  See the Mandelbrot example for a more complete
master/slave program.  A sample schema file is provided in this
directory (see the file "myapp"), or you can simply use mpirun to
launch the executable.  For example:

        mpirun C trivialc
        mpirun C trivialf
