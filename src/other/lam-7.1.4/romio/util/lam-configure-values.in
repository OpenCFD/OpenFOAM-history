# This file exists solely because ROMIO's configure.in is powered by a
# really od version of autoconf, such that we (the LAM Team) can't
# re-run autoconf on it.  Hence, the only way to get the values that
# are listed below from LAM's configure is to have LAM's configure
# generate this file and directly substitute them in (rather than pass
# them to ROMIO's configure, and have ROMIO's configure substitute
# them directly into romioinstall -- or use automake and avoid the
# whole romioinstall issue directly... arrgh....).  This sucks.
