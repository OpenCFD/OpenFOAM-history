History for LAM/MPI
===================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of LAM since version
1.0.

7.1.4
-----

- Work around some batch schedulers (BJS, LANL's BProc + MOAB)
  from killing the lamds when lamboot exits by keeping a child
  of lamboot around for the life of the lamds.
- Properly escape SSI parameters and pass SSI parameters to
  lamboot when using mpiexec.  Also use /tmp or $TMPDIR for
  the app schema.  Thanks to Sam Steingold for bringing this
  to our attention.
- Allow user to disable building the TM or SLURM boot ssi
  module, even if the libraries are available on the system.
  Thanks to Jens Klostermann for bringing this to our
  attention.
- Fix compile issue on NetBSD 3.0 and later.  Thanks to Aleksey
  Cheusov for the patch.
- Properly handle slurm clusters where all nodes do not have the
  same prefix in a hostname.  Thanks to Moe Jette for the patch.

7.1.3
-----

- A number of man page cleanups suggested by Eric Raymond.
- Search $PATH for tkill, in addition to the default install 
  location and $LAMHOME/bin.  Also, do not segfault if tkill 
  is not found after searching all these locations.  Thanks to
  Josh Lehan and Jeff Squyres for the patch.
- Abort rather than hang if lamboot is unable to get the list of
  local network devices.
- Fix for hangs in 64 bit builds on Mac OS X systems (Intel and
  PowerPC)
- Correct check for localhost in hostfiles during lamboot to check
  for 127.0.0.0/8 instead of 127.0.0.1/32, to meet RFC 1700.  Thanks
  to Martin Knoblauch for the patch.
- Added support for Fortran types MPI_REAL{4,8,16} for predefined
  reduction operations supported by floating point types (MPI_MAX,
  MPI_MIN, MPI_SUM, MPI_PROD).
- Fixed error in IB rpi that could cause compiler errors with some
  compilers.  Thanks to Jens Klostermann for bringing this to our
  attention.
- Fixed error with MPI_COMM_ACCEPT on Fedora 4 that would cause a
  "bad address error".  Thanks to Orion Poplawski for the fix.
- Renamed internal strtonum function lam_strtonum to avoid clashes
  with a function of the same name in FreeBSD.
- Fixed installation issue on Cygwin when trying to make symlinks to
  executables (such as lamwipe -> wipe).
- Fix bug with comments in hostfiles where a comment in the middle of
  a line would cause the entire line to be ignored.  Thanks to
  Christian Siebert for bringing this to our attention.
- Build the totalview queue debugging shared object as a dynamically
  loaded shared object instead of a shared library.  Fixes an issue
  on Mac OS X where the TotalView library could not be found.
- Cleanup restart logic in 'cr self' module. Add a bunch of documentation
  regarding this module to the man page, and user docs. Thanks to Jeff
  Squyres for helping in this effort.

7.1.2
-----

- Fix MPI_COMM_SPAWN problem with app schema info keys.
- Fix assembly problem for AIX in 64 bit mode with usysv.
- Fix bad cast in C++ bindings with MPI::Win::Create() that was
  causing an invalid MPI_Comm to be passed to the underlying
  MPI_Win_create() call.
- Woarkaround for newer MVAPI implementations that call free() in
  VAPI_deregister_mr(), which was causing hangs in certain situations.
  As a result, sbrk() is not called with a negative value, so for
  a very small number of applications, memory usage might be slightly
  higher.
- Fixed references to cr_base_dir in user docs -- the SSI parameters
  is actually cr_blcr_base_dir.
- Fixed error that resulted in wipe not properly using the session
  directory prefix/suffix options.  Thanks to Richard Winnett for
  bringing this to our attention.
- Fix two errors in ptmalloc2 code.  The "TSD hack"  was not properly
  enabled, causing an infinite loop leading to a segfault.  Also,
  we were not properly intercepting munmap().
- Fix a bug deep within MPI_INIT that prevented using IMPI.
- Updated to GNU Libtool 1.5.22.
- Add another setsid() in hboot to facilite working in SGE
  environments.
- Fixed a command-line parsing problem with mpiexec.  Thanks to
  Michael Lees for bringing this to our attention.
- Renable a few virtual destructors in the C++ bindings.  Thanks to
  Geoffrey Irving for pointing these out to us.
- Updated to GNU Automake 1.9.6.
- Don't add external declarations for the PMPI_W{TICK,TIME} functions
  if profiling isn't enabled.  It appers that some compilers (g95)
  will try to resolve the symbols if they are prototyped.
- Added work around for Apple's mis-interpretation of the use of
  semctl's 4th argument, as specified in IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition.
  Correct reading would say that the 4th argument when cmd is SETVAL
  should be the specified union, with the val having meaning.  Apple
  interpreted it to mean the 4th argument should be an integer.  There
  is significant difference on big-endian LP64 machines.  Note that
  every other 64 bit big endian Unix (including Linux, Solaris, AIX, 
  and IRIX) take the first interpretation.
- Added support for Fortran types MPI_INTEGER{1,2,4,8} for predefined
  reduction operations supported by Fortran integer types (MPI_MAX,
  MPI_MIN, MPI_SUM, MPI_PROD, MPI_BAND, MPI_BOR, MPI_BXOR).
- Fix problem where singletons and jobs launched via mpirun could not
  MPI_COMM_CONNECT / MPI_COMM_ACCEPT each other.  Thanks to Lei@ICS
  for pointing this out to us.
- Fix silly putenv() mistake in hboot.c.  Thanks to Guillaume
  Thomas-Collignon for bringing this to our attention.
- Work around bug in net/if.h header file on OS X 10.4 in 64bit mode
  that was preventing ioctl(..., SIOCGIFCONF, ...) from working.
  Thanks to the Apple engineering team for the suggestion.
- Fixed corner case in the rsh boot SSI module where we were invoking
  .profile on the remote side for Bash shells, when it really wasn't
  necessary (because bash will invoke .bashrc automatically).
- Properly handle MPI_*_NULL for the MPI_*_c2f functions.  Thanks to
  Anthony Chan for bringing this to our attention.
- Added missing MPI_ROOT definition to mpif.h.in.  Thanks to Roland
  Krause for pointing this out.
- Always populate mpirun's MPIR_proctable structure so that parallel
  debuggers can find all processes in the job.  Previously, the table
  was only populated if mpirun was also starting a parallel debugger
  daemon on all the nodes (ie, -tv was given as an option to mpirun).
  Thanks to the Absoft engineers for bringing this to our attention.
- Added access to the Fortran datatypes from the C mpi.h.  Thanks to
  Anthony Chan for asking for this feature.
- Change default behavior of lamhalt to wait until all lamds are dead
  before returning.  Add "-i" (immediate) option that replicates older
  (deprecated) behavior -- lamhalt returns immediately, most likely
  before the universe is completely halted.  Thanks to Pierre Valiron
  (and others who have previously run into this behavior) for shaming
  us into fixing properly.
- Added some missing man pages to LAM tarballs (lamnodes, lamhalt).
- Make the lack of a PATH environment variable in hboot not be an
  error.  Thanks to Swan for pointing this out to us.
- Added $LDFLAGS and $LIBS to various configure tests that link
  Fortran executables so that systems with icky Fortran installations
  can add additional linker flags / libraries.  Documented that OS X
  Tiger (10.4) users should probably add LIBS=-lSystemStubs to their
  configure line because gfortran doesn't do it automatically, and not
  having it will cause several of our tests to [incorrectly] fail due
  to missing symbols.
- MPI_GET_VERSION checked to see if MPI_INIT had already been called,
  which is erroneous (MPI-2, 3.1).  Thanks to Dries Kimpe for bringing
  this to our attention.
- Somehow the processing for lamboot's -b option was removed; fixed.
  Thanks to Davide Cesari for pointing this out.
- Per advice from the ROMIO maintainers, remove some NFS locking tests
  from romio/configure.
- Fixed a problem with the upper and lower bounds when creating DARRAY
  datatypes.  Thanks to Florin Isaila for identifying the problem, and
  to George Bosilca for helping with the fix.
- Fixed number of prefix 0's generated in SLURM host lists.  Thanks to
  Dave Henseler for helping with the fix.
- Fixed MPI_ALLTOALLW fortran wrapper.  Thanks to Roderick Johnstone
  for supplying the fix.
- Fixed a potential infinite loop in tkill if some system calls
  returned bogus values.
- Make BSD systems have a default of "none" for the memory manager.
  Thanks to William Bierman for bringing this to our attention.
- The SLURM boot SSI module help messages all accidentally had the 
  wrong filename, so if anything ever went wrong, no help message
  would be printed.  Fixed.
- Workaround for a bug in some versions of gcc that masked the
  debugging definition of struct _proc, which caused problems when
  using the TotalView debugger.  Thanks to Ilya Lashuk for bringing
  this to our attention, and for Josh the Etnus support engineer for
  suggesting the workaround.
- Changed LAM Basic MPI_Bcast binomial tree algorithm to complete
  send to one process before starting the next send, resulting in
  much better performance in some situations.  Thanks to Olaf
  Hartmann for both discovering the issue and supplying a patch.
- Fixed bug in smp collective module that would cause corrupted
  collective operation if multiple communicators with different
  sizes were created.  Thanks to Bob Felderman for help tracking
  down the issue.
- Fixed bug that allowed multi-word $CC values to accidentally
  propagate to incorrect places (like WRAPPER_EXTRA_LDFLAGS).  Thanks
  for Rodney Mach for identifying this issue.
- Fix ROMIO test for Fotran linking convention on OS X by using
  nm instead of strings on that platform
- Update to the Totalview docs for TV v6.6; thanks to the Etnus and
  Absoft support engineers who brought this to our attention.
- Fixed problem with zero padding in Slurm host list parsing.  Thanks
  to Stuart Watson and Bryan O'Sullivan for pointing this out to us.
- Add support for BProc implementations without bproc_vexecmove
  support.  Thanks to Massimiliano Fatica and Josh Lehan for supplying
  the patches.
- Fixed bad egrepping in configure to snarf LDFLAGS and LIBS from
  generated Makefiles.  Thanks to Ralf Wildenhues for finding and
  fixing this problem.
- Fixed errors in pthread tests that could result in incorrect 
  flags being set for threading when f77 is used for linking.  Also
  fixed an error where the Linux pthreads test could give a harmless
  false positive
- Converted IMPI coll module to coll API v1.1.0.
- Fixed verbosity in coll selection to print the module that was
  selected, not the last module that was examined.
- Fix problem with the usysv RPI on the Apple G5 platform.  The G5 can
  reorder writes to improve memory performance, which was causing
  failures in the synchronization routines.  Added "sync" instruction
  to force data / lock writes to be ordered.  Thanks to Jacob Vos for
  bringing the problem to our attention.
- Expanded ib RPI configure tests to look for vapi.h and the VAPI
  libraries in odd places for some IB implementations.  Thanks to Greg
  Kurtzer for pointing this out.
- Fix some forgotten / bit-rot compile errors in the impi coll module.
  Thanks to Luiz Angelo Barchet-Estefanel for pointing these out.
- Set a number of LAM daemon sockets to be close on exec to eliminate
  wasted file descriptors in clients
- Reordered tkill shutdown to better support platforms with /tmp in
  NFS.
- Patch libtool to recognize Portland C compilers so that snarfing
  flags from libtool does the right thing in the MPI wrapper
  compilers.  Thanks to Greg Kurtzner for pointing this out.
- Fixed compile problem with recent gcc versions (missing #include in
  a really old source file).  Thanks to Ryuta Suzuki and Tim Prins for
  bringing this to our attention.
- Fix a problem with some ancient F77 compilers and remove all single
  and double quotes from mpif.h.  Thanks to Arun Rodrigues (formerly
  of LAM/MPI fame) for pointing this out.
- Fix a problem inadvertantly caused by bug 682: instead of trying to
  rectify crmpi modules that are sent by MPI processes to the spawning
  agent, simply disallow MPI_COMM_SPAWN'ed processes from being
  checkpointable.  Thanks to ducong and Neville Lee for bringing this
  to our attention.
- LAM no longer examines the (argc, argv) that comes in from MPI_INIT
  because it can cause problems in some scenarios.  Thanks to Gareth
  Williams for pointing this out.
- Fix an uninitialized variable that can cause seg faults in the rsh
  boot SSI.  Thanks to Ricardo Pereira for pointing this out.
- Re-enable stdin for rank 0; this was accidentally disabled in 7.1.
  Thanks to Carlo Carloni Calame for pointing this out.
- Add a configure test for inet_ntop() in the slurm boot module so
  that environments that do not have that function (e.g., Cygwin) will
  not attempt to compile the slurm module.  Thanks to Siegmar Gross
  for pointing this out.
- Fix wrapper compiler LDFLAGS and LIBS.  Thanks to Robin Humble for
  pointing this out.
- Updated User Guide to clarify the ib RPI module scalability
  restrictions.
- Re-enable a virtual destructor for MPI::Comm_null.  Thanks to
  Fredrik Hedman for pointing this out.
- Escape linker flags added to the wrapper compilers' LDFLAGS to
  support the OS X malloc intercept code with -Wl,.  The XL compilers
  were getting confused by the -u _lam_darwin_malloc_linker_hack
  option when it was passed to them.
- Add zsh to the list of shells that do not have the .profile script
  explicitly run for lamboot.  This list includes csh-derived shells
  and bash, as both have a set of scripts run for non-interactive
  logins.
- Fix missing space in test for the existance of a .profile script
  when using an sh-derived shell.

7.1.1
-----

- Upgraded to Libtool v1.5.8.
- Added rpi_ib_mtu SSI param (see User Guide for more info).
- Fixed minor problem with ib RPI startup code that prevented it from
  working on some vendor IB stacks.
- Fixed problem with --export-dynamic showed up in the wrapper
  compiler underlying commands.  Thanks to several LAM users who
  brought it to our attention.
- Don't emit warning on stderr and abort if we get a permission denied
  when killing a process with tkill.  If the lamd dies uncleanly, it
  is possible for another process (possibly with another user) to end
  up with that lamd's pid which will cause tkill to have problems
  later (if the pid is another users).  Thanks to Phil Ehrens for
  bringing this one to our attention.

7.1
---

- Add the --with-memory-manager=external flag that allows LAM to be
  configured to allow external triggering of its sbrk() interception
  code.  See the LAM/MPI Installation Guide release notes on Myrinet
  and Infiniband for more details.
- Added first version of Infiniband RPI module (ib).
- Fix a problem where $includedir/lam_config.h may end up with
  permissions affected by the installer's default umask instead of
  being set to 0644.  Thanks to Ming Kin Lai for pointing this out, as
  well as various documentation fixes.
- Added preliminary support for the upcoming BProc 4.0 release.  Thank
  you to Luke Palmer and Daniel Gruner for helping test the changes.
- Added ability for mpirun to start applications that have execute but
  not read permissions (thanks to dling@mtu.edu for pointing this
  out).  Only works if the -s option is not given to mpirun.  Also
  fixed path searching problem when ./test was specified as command to
  mpirun.
- mpirun is now better about returning non-zero in the cases where
  the launched job aborts before calling MPI_INIT.
- Add support for ptmalloc2 and Apple Darwin/OS X memory managers when
  catching deallocations for unpinning user memory.
- Added possibility of using IMPI_HOST_NAME environment variable for
  external name publishing.  Thanks to Alexander Inyukhin for
  contributing a path for this.
- Fixed ordering of LAM_SESSION_SUFFIX and batch system ID evaluation
  when determining the session directory suffix.  Thanks to Rich Drake
  for pointing out this problem.
- Added collectives for inter-communicators.
- Added SHMEM coll SSI module.
- Add C++ constants MPI::ARGV_NULL and MPI::ARGVS_NULL
- Added rpi_tcp_sockbuf and rpi_crtcp_sockbuf SSI params to set OS
  socket buffering sizes.
- Added support for optional MPI datatypes MPI_INTEGER1, MPI_INTEGER2,
  MPI_INTEGER4, MPI_REAL4, and MPI_REAL8.  Added support for non-existant 
  MPI datatypes (!) MPI_INTEGER8, MPI_REAL16.
- Added boot_rsh_ignore_stderr SSI parameter for users too lazy to fix
  their "dot" files.  :-)  Thanks to Randy Bramley for suggesting this
  feature.
- Added SLURM boot SSI module.
- Added support for run-time dynamically loaded SSI modules.  A LAM
  installation can therefore be extended by simply adding a shared
  library SSI module into a specific directory.
- Various gm RPI fixes:
  - Added --with-rpi-gm-lib option to specify a non-default location
    for the GM library.  Thanks to Tom Crockett for pointing this out.
  - Fix for incorrectly handling when gm dropped packets.  Thanks to
    several LAM users pointing this out to us.
  - Performance improvements in the gm RPI; no more "short" message
    protocol -- only "tiny" and "long".
  - Added "fast" support for the gm rpi module, although it's
    unreliable for communication-intense applications (and therefore
    disabled by default).
  - Support for building the gm rpi module dynamically.
  - The gm RPI module now supports checkpoint/restart (must set the
    rpi_gm_cr SSI parameter to 1), but only when used with gm_get()
    (see below).
  - Enable experimental use of the gm 2.x gm_get() function for long
    messages when explicitly asked for with the --with-rpi-gm-get
    configure switch.
- Added smp-aware collective algorithms for the following MPI
  functions: MPI_ALLGATHER, MPI_ALLGATHERV, MPI_REDUCE_SCATTER,
  MPI_SCAN.
- Added new MPI functions: MPI_EXSCAN and MPI_ALLTOALLW.
- Added the feature of preventing cascading of help messages (on a per 
  helpfile basis). This feature can be turned off by setting the 
  LAM_MPI_ALLOW_CASCADE_HELP environment variable.
- Added "mpi_hostmap" SSI parameter to transform the IP addresses
  supplied by the LAM run-time environment to an alternate set of
  addresses that will be used for MPI communications.  Thanks to
  Jean-Marie Teuler and Robin Humble for suggesting this feature.
- Added option "-prefix </lam/install/path>" in lamboot and lamwipe 
  to allow users to switch between LAM installations without having
  to modify their local environments.
- Added "prefix" parameter for the rsh boot module boot schema files
  to allow users to specify different LAM installation paths on
  different nodes.
- Added a new MPI_COMM_SPAWN info key (lam_no_root_node_schedule) to
  disallow processes to be spawned on the root node.
- Wrapper compilers now do not add any additional flags unless there
  is at least one argv that does not begin with "-" (e.g., "mpicc -v"
  will not add any additional LAM/MPI-specific flags).
- Added options:cxx_exceptions output in laminfo to indicate whether
  LAM was configured --with-cxx-exceptions or not.
- Added -param option to laminfo to display available SSI parameters
  and their default values.
- Added -showme:compile and -showme:link flags to the wrapper
  compilers for printing out the compiler and linker flags,
  respectively.  For example "cc foo.c `mpicc -showme:compile`" and
  "cc foo.o `mpicc -showme:link` -o foo".
- Renamed "wipe" command to "lamwipe" per request from the Mandrake
  Cooker team.  The name "wipe" is now deprecated, and will be removed
  in some future release.
- Added "lamcheckpoint" and "lamrestart" commands.  These commands can 
  be used to call the module-specific Checkpoint and Restart functions.

7.0.7 (unreleased; all changes included in 7.1)
-----------------------------------------------

- Removed the reset of the MAKE macro in romio/Makefile.in that
  disallowed using a make other that what is found at configure time.
  Thanks to Richard Hadsell for tracking this down.
- Fixed some missing <etc_misc.h> header files that caused unresolved
  symbols on some platforms.  Thanks to Richard Hadsell for tracking
  this down.
- Added possitiblity of --without-exflags to force *not* using any
  special C++ exception compiler flags.  Thanks to Richard Hadsell for
  pointing this out.
- Fix man page sections.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for pointing out
  these errors.
- Only execute .profile if it exists in the rsh module.  Thanks for
  the patch from Camm Maguire.
- Fixed error in lamnet code used to find available interfaces when
  we don't pre-allocate enough space (on FreeBSD - thanks to Masakazu 
  Higaki for pointing out this problem).

7.0.6
-----

- Fixed error in lamnet code used to find available interfaces when
  we don't pre-allocate enough space.
- Fixed ordering of LAM_SESSION_SUFFIX and batch system ID evaluation
  when determining the session directory suffix.  Thanks to Rich Drake
  for pointing out this problem.

7.0.5
-----

- Fix an obscure race condition that could occur if running in a LAM
  universe with more than 255 nodes.  Thanks to Robin Humble for
  pointing this out.
- Changed the lam-helpfile to correct the error in lamboot synopsis.
  Added '-s' and delineate the options -bdhHlsvVx.  Thanks to Richard
  Hadsell for pointing this out.  Also corrected all those cases where
  all options were lumped together.
- Add fix to set TCP socket buffer size to run-time value of
  ssi_rpi_tcp_short / ssi_rpi_crtcp_short in all rpi modules, as
  relevant.
- Fix minor prototype problem with lam_ksignal().  Thanks to Satya
  Gosula for pointing this out.
- Make network interface code allow for arbitrary numbers of
  interfaces on the localhost.  Thanks to Neil Storer for pointing
  this out.
- Add dependant libraries for the PBS TM library on Solaris.  Thanks
  to Tom Crockett for pointing this out.
- Fixes to the SGE detection logic for the session directory.  Thanks
  to the SGE Development Team for assistance with the correct logic.
- Updates to documentation about Globus module.  Thanks to 
  Siva (sbandham) for pointing this out to us.


7.0.4
-----

- Update docs to reflect true behavior of LAM_MPI_SESSION_PREFIX.
- Do not propagate LAM_MPI_SESSION_PREFIX via mpirun.  Thanks to
  Andras Laszloffy for pointing this out.
- Fixed crtcp rpi deadlock handling for deferred writes during a
  checkpoint in the presence of other blocking reads.
- Better fix for libtool 1.5 broken icc -c/-o test; patch the
  generated configure script to remove the bad commands.
- Fixed minor typo in blcr cr module configure scripts.


7.0.3
-----

- Minor fixes with bad printf() formats in the kenyad and blcr/crlam.
  Thanks to Paul Hargrove for pointing these out to us.
- Workaround for libtool 1.5 bug with the Intel compiler (libtool
  didn't think that icc supported -c and -o at the same time).  Thanks
  to Jon Bernard for bringing this to our attention.
- Changed LAM_CONFIGURE_* macros from -D command line arguments to
  #define's to prevent problems with some compilers that don't like
  -D values with embedded spaces.  Thanks to Harshu for bringing this
  to our attention.
- Changed search order for Fortran compilers to look for GNU g77 before
  f77 so that the default matches the defaults for the C and C++
  compilers.  Thanks to Siegmar Gross for pointing this out.
- Removed LAM_NEED_SYS_SELECT_H, instead including sys/select.h any time
  it is available.
- Updated SYS V semaphore and shmem tests to check for functionality.  Adds
  -lrt (Solaris) and -lcygipc (Cygwin) if needed.
- Added configure switch --with-fd-setsize to increase the size of an
  FD_SET and increase the soft per-process file descriptor limit on
  platforms that support such things.  This should allow larger TCP
  LAM jobs on platforms that support large FD_SET arrays.  Be sure to
  read the release notes for your platform before using this option.
- Fix issue with timeouts in the lamd's ACK code.  It appears this was
  due to a longstanding confusion as to whether TO_DLO_ACK was in
  seconds or microseconds.


7.0.2
-----

- Fixed a problem in LAM's distribution scripts that accidentally left
  out the gm RPI from the 7.0.1 tarballs.


7.0.1
-----

- Added a workaround for Portland 5.0 C++ compiler bug in the C++
  bindings.
- Removed legacy function panic() because it conflicts with a function
  in OS X's system headers with the same name.
- Fixed a problem with the sbrk() declaration in ptmalloc.c and the
  Portland C compiler.
- Fixed a problem with the boot_rsh_agent SSI parameter not being
  recognized properly.  Thanks to Andre Gosselin for pointing this
  out.
- Fixed a problem with mpirun's default running with tracing enabled.
  Tracing is now only enabled if -t, -ton, or -toff is specified on the
  mpirun command line (see mpirun(1) for more information).  Thanks to
  Thomas Klein for pointing this out.
- Fixed a memory leak when freeing a datatype created by
  MPI_Type_create_hindexed. Thanks to Thomas Klein for bringing this
  to our attention.
- Fixed a minor problem with the cr_base_dir SSI parameter.
- Fixed a couple of problems with duplicate symbols on OS X when 
  using the Fortran bindings.
- Fixed thread configure tests to test a much wider variety of thread
  compiler and linker flags.
- Ensure that relevant compiler and linker flags are propgated properly
  to SSI configure scripts so that we compile all of LAM with the same
  flags.
- Added support for GM-2.x in the gm rpi module.
- Removed errant "-" typo in MPI_Intercomm_merge.  Thanks to Andrew
  Cunningham for pointing this out.
- Minor #include fixes for FreeBSD 4.x.  Thanks to Brooks Davis for
  pointing this out.
- Made the tests for getsockopt() and recvfrom() more robust.
- Fixed a problem with opening unix sockets with really long filenames
  (e.g., in PBS Pro environments).  Thanks to Jon Bernard, Steven
  Wilson, and Lev Gorenstein for identifying the problem.
- Add --with-romio-libs=LIBS to allow passing of arbitrary
  LDFLAGS/LIBS args down to the environment of ROMIO's configure
  script and also into the wrapper compilers.  e.g., when building
  ROMIO with PVFS support, "-lpvfs" needs to be added in both places.
  Thanks to Randy Bramley and Cathy Yuan for pointing this out.


7.0
---

- Allow ROMIO to be built even if LAM is built with shared libraries.
  This is still experimental, but seems to work.
- Allow the internal "name" (argv[0] to underlying MPI_Init) for
  FORTRAN programs to be overridden by the environment variable
  LAM_MPI_PROCESS_NAME.
- Fixed file descriptor leak for non-MPI processes (and MPI procs that
  do not exit properly) in the lamd.  Avoid passing stdin Trollius
  fd around, so that it doesn't get leaked.
- Added mpiexec for portable MPI process startup (described in MPI 2
  standard).  mpiexec also has support for "one shot" lamboot, mpirun
  and lamhalt.
- Restore umask to original value when launching application from the
  lamd, as the lamd runs with a umask of 077.
- Updated ROMIO to v1.2.5.1.  Revamped ROMIO configure/build process
  to be better integrated with LAM.
- bproc boot SSI support added; can now lamboot on bproc clusters
  (still launches a lamd on every node).  Added bonus that "mpirun
  [C|N] foo" will, by default, not run on the bproc head node.  Thanks
  to Nicholas Henke for oodles of patches, development, and general
  advice.
- lamnodes now reports per-node flags, such as "origin", "this_node",
  and "no_schedule".
- Re-activated long-unused feature in LAM to not schedule MPI and
  serial processes on selected nodes.  For example, you can lamboot on
  a head node and some compute nodes and have "mpirun C foo" only run
  on the compute nodes.
- Added new laminfo command to get detailed information about LAM's
  configuration, including available SSI modules and their various
  version numbers.
- Added support for attaching TotalView debugger to MPI processes
  launched by mpirun, including support for the partial-attach feature
  provided by TotalView.  Also include support for examining messages
  queues.
- Increased the number of MPI tags and communicator contexts available
  in all RPIs where this was possible (i.e., everything except lamd).
  MPI jobs that do not use the lamd RPI will now automatically get use
  of more MPI tags and simultaneous communicators.  Additionally,
  increased the efficiency of the communicator context ID allocation
  algorithm (at the expense of communication efficiency during
  communicator construction).
- MPI collectives have been SSI-ized.  The LAM collective algorithms
  have been moved into a module named lam_basic.  See lamssi_coll(7).
- Try to use -pthread when compiling with POSIX threads and GNU
  compilers, since many Linux / BSD-flavored distributions include
  this flag in the local configurations.  Failing that, fall back to
  -D_REENTRANT and -lpthread.  Thanks to Todd Fries for the
  suggestion.
- When the LAM daemon is killed by SIGTERM, it will gracefully kill
  all of its sub-processes, release all of its resources, and die
  nicely (as opposed to just dying).
- LAM will use the $TMPDIR environment variable to determine where
  to create temporary files
- Added "promiscuous" and "expected" modes for base SSI boot
  protocols, where connections are accepted from any IP address or
  only from the IP addresses listed in the boot schema, respectively.
- The back-end process for lamboot (and friends) have been SSI-ized
  with the "boot" SSI kind.  See lamssi_boot(7).  Currently have two 
  boot modules available: rsh (which also does ssh) and tm (for PBS).
- Added the MPI-2 C++ bindings implementation for "MPI::Win".
- Added --with-wrapper-extra-ldflags option to configure that parses
  the output of libtool to get the extra compiler/linker flags and put
  them into the wrapper compilers (e.g., shared library run-time
  search path).
- The memcpy() in glibc performs poorly if the copy size is not
  divisable by 4.  Added a workaround to significantly increase LAM's
  shmem RPIs and unexpected message buffering performance in these
  cases, as well as command line configure switches to enable/disable
  this behavior (--with-prefix-memcpy and --without-prefix-memcpy).
  Thanks to Dr. Dave Turner for identifying this problem and
  suggesting fixes.
- Changed the bit mapping in error codes that are used in MPI because
  the field specifying the MPI function was only 8 bits, yet there are
  300+ functions in MPI.  This unfortunately changes the bit mapping
  of the errorcode argument in MPI_Abort; see the MPI_Abort(3) man
  page for more information.
- Added functionality per MPI-2:4.8 -- attributes added to
  MPI_COMM_SELF will be deleted as nearly the first thing in
  MPI_FINALIZE, effectively allowing user-specified functions during
  MPI_FINALIZE.
- Removed MPIL_Spawn (LAM-specific, pre-MPI-2 spawn call).
- MPI thread support now MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED.  We don't enforce any
  distinction between FUNNELED or SERIALIZED, so it is possible to
  write a threaded application that runs fine on LAM but causes issues
  on other platforms.
- Print out friendly error message from wrapper compilers if underlying
  compiler isn't found.
- There are now lots of run-time tunable parameters for the various
  RPIs.  See the lamssi_rpi(7) man page for a list of the tunable
  parameters that can be passed in to each RPI.
- The first System Services Interface (SSI) kind has been added -- the
  RPI layers have been converted to SSI.  Now all available RPI's are
  compiled in simultaneously and you can choose which to use at
  run-time.  See the mpirun(1), lamssi(7), and lamssi_rpi(7) man
  pages.
- Fixed a problem where if $prefix is /usr, hf77 would complain that
  it could not find the ROMIO and MPI-2 C++ libraries.  This isn't too
  important for 6.6.x since we've totally re-written the wrapper
  compilers, but we record the bug fix anyway.  Thanks to Trond Eivind
  Glomsrod for pointing this out.
- Completely rewrote the Myri/gm RPI.  It's smaller, faster, and
  generally mo' better.
- Only install lam-bhost.def if one does not exist in $(sysconfdir).
  Thanks for Martin Siegert for the suggestion.
- Renamed lam-conf.lam and lam-conf.otb to lam-conf.lamd and
  lam-conf.separate to make the meanings more obvious and less
  confusing with the corresponding lam-bhost.* files.  Renamed
  lam-conf.lam to be lam-conf.example to make its purpose more
  obvious, and no longer install it under $(sysconfdir).
- Added the MPI-2 C++ bindings implementation for "MPI::Info".
- Make mpirun's error message about abnormal MPI process exit
  distinguish between deaths caused by signals and by deaths caused by
  abnormal exit statuses.
- Added the "C++ only" datatypes specified in the MPI-2 standard:
  MPI_BOOL, MPI_COMPLEX, MPI_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, and
  MPI_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, as well as the built-in operands specified
  in the standard.  Note that the complex types will *only* work if 
  the implementation of complex<float> allows casting to 
  struct { float r ; float i; } ; (and likewise for double and 
  long double).  This seems to be the case everywhere we have seen.
- Fixed a couple small problems that prevented running the lamd as
  a group of processes.  Moved -b from $inet_topo to $socket_suffix
  in the lam-conf files.
- Added version checking for applications - a nice error message will
  be printed if user runs under one version of LAM and has compile
  against some other version of LAM.
- Added output of IP address to failure notice in mpirun (in addition
  to the node number, which only has meaning in that particular LAM
  run-time environment. Thanks to Matthias Troyer for the suggestion.
- Add version checking into the LAM commands and MPI_INIT.  If a user
  attempts to run a LAM or MPI program that does not match the version
  of the lamd that is running, a warning message will be displayed and
  the program will bail.
- Able to finally remove the automake_bogosity.[c|h] files and extra
  noinst_HEADERS/noinst_PROGRAMS rules from various
  directories/Makefile.am's.
- Add -nn and -np options to lamboot, recon, and wipe to prevent
  adding "-n" to the remote agent command line and to prevent the
  execution of $HOME/.profile on the remote side, even if the remote
  shell is Bourne.
- In addition to the syslog, send lamd debugging output to the
  lam-debug-log.txt file in the LAM session directory.  This is
  particularly helpful since many linux distributions do not allow
  normal users to view the syslog.
- Related to the note below (LAM session directory located on a
  networked filesystem), add a workaround in the flatd when attempting
  to open a new flatd temp file in the LAM session directory with
  O_APPEND.  If the first attempt to open a new file fails, try again
  without O_APPEND.
- Pass "-d" to tkill during lamboot (through hboot) if lamboot was
  invoked with "-d".
- Some fixes to the gm RPI, particularly with respect to allocating
  and freeing memory.
- Add specific error message for the case where the gm RPI is unable
  allocate a gm port.  This is much more helpful than an amorphous
  "something went wrong during MPI_INIT" message.
- Robust-ized lamhalt such that it will timeout (after 15 seconds) if
  it doesn't receive all the HALT ACKs back that it thinks that it
  should receive -- and prints out an appropriate error message
  indicating which nodes it didn't get ACKs from.
- Various minor improvements in the build system.
- Integrated the C++ bindings into the configure/build system better.
- Revamped the configure system for future extensibility.  Updated
  build system to use Autoconf 2.52, Automake 1.5, and Libtool 1.4.2
  (or higher).
- Added a specific check to ensure MPI_INIT is not called after
  MPI_FINALIZE.  This is a special case of the check that no
  MPI function was called after MPI_FINALIZE, as new users tend
  not to realize that you can't re-INIT a process.


6.6b1
-----

- Removed the LAM-version-checking code from the mpi2c++ bindings;
  they're really not necessary since we're inside LAM anyway.
- Fixed ambiguity of RTF_KENYA flag being used for two purposes
  (forked from the kenyad and attached to the kenyad), and split it
  into RTF_KEYNA_CHILD and RTF_KEYNA_ATTACH.
- Changed the behavior of the --with-rsh option in configure.  Now,
  rather than always putting the full path in lam_config.h, it only
  adds the full path when an absolute or relative path was given
  (as opposed to just a binary name).
- First public release of Myrinet/gm support in the gm RPI.
- Fixed a problem where two different flags had the accidentally same
  value on a request, which lead to truncation errors in one-sided
  communications in lamd mode when the daemons were compiled
  separately.
- Added better support to mpirun and the kenyad to catch when an MPI
  process dies without first detaching (i.e., calling MPI_FINALIZE).
- Re-added hooks to create/remove the "impirun" sym link in $(bindir)
  during "make install"/"make uninstall".  These were lost when we
  converted to an automake-style build.  Thanks to Brian Vinter for
  bringing this to our attention.
- Fixed a bug in dlo_inet in fault tolerant mode.  On some OSes, 
  recvfrom() can return ECONNREFUSED, which should not cause an
  abort in FT mode.  Thanks to Pavel for the bug report.
- Fixed a problem when a process sends a LAM signal to itself via
  kdoom(); the signal handler would erroneously get triggered twice.
  Thanks to Sethuram Rajamani for pointing this out.
- Added the MPI_Info key "lam_spawn_sched_round_robin" on
  MPI_COMM_SPAWN to allow finer-grained control on the placement of
  spawned MPI processes without the need to write an app schema to a
  temporary file (and allows functionality that you can't really do
  with an app schema, anyway).  See MPI_Comm_spawn(1) for more
  information on this key.
- Renamed the MPI_Info key name on MPI_COMM_SPAWN "file" to
  "lam_spawn_file".  Since it is a LAM-specific key, it should have a
  LAM-specific name.  While the "file" key still exists for backwards
  compatability, its use is deprecated.
- Added two predefined attributes on MPI_COMM_WORLD:
  LAM_UNIVERSE_NCPUS and LAM_UNIVERSE_NNODES.  They return the number
  of CPUs in the current LAM universe and the number of nodes in the
  current LAM universe (respectively).  Note that these values can be
  larger than their corresponding counts from the application's
  MPI_COMM_WORLD.
- Increase the default optimization flags in configure to be -O3 for
  gcc/g++, -O for all other compilers.
- Moved the handling of signals in user code from signal handlers
  installed by MPI_INIT to the lamd and mpirun.  That is, the lamd
  will now detect that a process died due to a signal and send back
  that information to mpirun.  mpirun will print out the appropriate
  error messages.  This has the side effect of allowing the OS default
  signal handlers to be used in user programs rather than the LAM
  singal handlers.  In at least some cases, this is a good thing --
  some users want core dumps, for example.  Two new options have been
  added to mpirun -- "-sigs" and "-nsigs", to enable / disable the LAM
  signal handlers from MPI_INIT .  "-nsigs" is now the default, since
  the lamd/mpirun make these signal handlers redundant.  However,
  "-sigs" will enable the old behavior for backwards compatibility.
- Fixed a bunch of potential signed / unsigned comparison problems.
  This was a real bug in at least one case, which could effectively
  result in garbage being sent to the lamd, which would cause the lamd
  to eventually die.
- Fixed up lamnodes to print more intelligible error messages when you
  specify an illegal node/CPU.
- Ensure that the directory where the lamd named socket lives is not
  left around if you invoke a LAM command when there is no lamd
  running.  Moved the function lam_rmdir() from tkill.c to
  share/etc/kill.c, and renamed it to be lam_rmsocknamedir(), and
  ensured that it is called when kinit() fails because there is no
  lamd.  Thanks to Scott Morton for pointing this out.
- Made LAM's signal handler a bit smarter by checking to see if it is
  already in ths signal handler.  e.g., if a callback function has
  been registered via atexit()/onexit() and causes a seg fault after
  the signal handler has been triggered the first time, this can cause
  a loop of seg faults which is quite difficult to kill.  LAM's signal
  handler will now detect this situation and gracefully abort().  This
  has come up before on the LAM list; the most recent was from Camm
  Maguire.


6.5.10
------

- In the signal handler for the C++ test suite, use the POSIX function
  sigemptyset() to zero out the sa_mask instead of just assigning 0.
  This is necessary for the Linux icc (C++) compiler, which will
  generate an error if you try to just assign 0 (no valid constructor
  to cast from 0 to the appropriate type).  Thanks to Jon Bernard for
  pointing this out.


6.5.9
-----

- Fixed behavior of hf77 (mpif77) to always -I$prefix/include, even
  when $prefix == /usr.  This is different than hcc (mpicc/mpiCC),
  because the fortran compiler will not look in /usr/include by
  default, but the C/C++ compiler will.
- Updated BSD4.4 file descriptor passing (again).  Now have support
  for API defined in RFC 2292 (Advanced Sockets API for IPv6), as
  suggested by the Suse AMD Hammer team and implemented in 6.5.8 and
  the API defined in POSIX.1g, which is basically the support provided
  before 6.5.8.
- Passed architecture of "freebsd" to ROMIO configure when building
  on Mac OS X or Darwin, removing the need for the -DNO_AIO hack.
  Thanks to the ROMIO team for the hint.
- Cleaned up use and declaration of errno in LAM.  There are no more
  extern int errno declarations.  Files include either terror.h (which
  includes errno.h) or errno.h.
- Added <args.h> to share/etc/kill.c and otb/sys/flatd/flatd.c so that
  snprintf mapping to lam_snprintf would happen properly on
  architectures that do not have snprintf.
- Changed --with-fc / $FC handling to allow passing of command line
  switches to propogate through to mpif77.  This is the same behavior
  as --with-cc / $CC and --with-cxx / $CXX.  Thanks to Mike Pacey for
  pointing this out.


6.5.8
-----

- Updated BSD4.4 file descriptor passing to fit expected use.  Thanks
  to the Suse AMD Hammer crew for all the help.
- Removed duplicate free in fortran SPWAN_MULTIPLE call


6.5.7
-----

- Removed some duplicate free's in fortran MPI calls.
- Change LAM's registry to not depend on the O_EXCL flag to open().
  Use an alternative locking mechanism if it is determined (at run
  time) that O_EXCL will not work in the LAM session directory.  This
  can happen when the LAM session directory is on a networked
  filesystem.  Thanks to Yusuke Tanimura for initially bringing the
  problems with having a LAM session directory on a networked
  fileystem (e.g., Linux NFS) to our attention, and the generous use
  of his cluster to figure out how to fix it.
- Update for MPI 2.1 errata: MPI_GET_COUNT behavior with respect to 0
  byte datatypes now returns 0 (vs. MPI_UNDEFINED) when 0 data bytes
  have been transferred.
- Fix the lamd kernel to set the kill file to be close-on-exec so that
  it is not inherited by child processes (this can cause a problem
  during lamhalt if the LAM session directory is on NFS -- tkill will
  inherit the open file descriptor and then remove the file.  NFS will
  then created a ".nfsXXXXX" cache file entry, which will prevent the
  removal of the directory).
- Removed linking to the C++ bindings when using mpicc and mpif77
  because this creates a problem when using gcc 3.0, and it doesn't
  make sense anyway.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for pointing this out.
- Fixed minor issue with show_help() that could cause problems for
  help messages with large numbers of arguments.  Thanks to wierenga
  for contributing the patch.
- Fixed a problem in the main lamd kernel on NetBSD where select()
  will zero out fd_sets even on "accepted" failures.  Thanks to Tom
  Everett for access to a NetBSD machine to test on.
- Fixed a problem in the kernel where we were assuming that all
  "ready" FDs in a set would be set in a select() was causing
  a file descriptor "leak" (it was cleaned up by lamclean) that
  would result in the inability to launch MPI jobs under Mac OS X.
- Updated man page installation to not install man pages with
  conflicting names on file systems that are not case sensitive.
- Removed use of .so nroff "include" directive in man pages; it didn't
  work on all platforms.  Also updated some text in the mpicc and
  mpif77 man pages.
- Changed name of binary for C++ compiler to mpic++.  On most systems,
  there will be a symlink from mpiCC -> mpic++.  On systems without
  a case sensitive file system (like HFS+ on Mac OS X), this symlink
  will not be created, as it conflicts with mpicc.
- Add checks for if running under an LSF job, and automatically set
  the socket suffix to be the LSF job ID (a la how PBS jobs are already
  handled).
- Fixed a problem where the IMPI client was not properly endianizing
  IMPI_CMD_FINI before sending it to the IMPI server.  Thanks to
  Dzmitry Vadalazhski for pointing this out.
- Fixed a problem where if $prefix is /usr, hf77 would complain that
  it could not find the ROMIO and MPI-2 C++ libraries.  Thanks to
  Trond Eivind Glomsrod for pointing this out.
- Fixed problem in lamopenlog(), where we passed a priority to
  openlog() instead of a level.  Thanks to Martin-D. Lacasse for
  pointing this out.
- In share/etc/kill.c, kill off LAM directory with rmdir(), not
  remove() - it appears that MacOS X will not allow remove() to be
  called on a directory.


6.5.6
-----

- Fixed a problem with mpi++.h in the Linux RPMs. 
- Fixed two typos in MPI_INIT that prevented MPI_F_DOUBLE_COMPLEX from
  being initialized properly.  Thanks for Heinz Bast for pointing this
  out.
- Fixed some name clashes with the Fortran interface when the linking
  semantics are FORTRANUPPERCASE.  There is a name clash between some
  C and Fortran constants in this case.  A longer discussion of the
  problem can be found in MPISYSF.h.  In addition, reworked our Fotran
  alignment and data type size configure tests so that they work with
  Fortran compilers that actually have mixed case linking semantics
- Worked around a bug in FreeBSD 4.2 with the CMSG_DATA macro.  On
  FreeBSD, CMSG_DATA uses a macro named ALIGN, which was not included
  in the proper header files.  We include sys/param.h if needed to
  make programs using CMSG_DATA link properly.
- Added support for platforms without SysV semaphores.  Configure will
  not allow selection of the SYSV or USYSV RPIs if on a platform
  without SysV semaphores.  Edited share/etc/registry.c to remove all
  references to SysV semaphores if they don't exist.


6.5.5
-----

- Made IMPI extensions be part of the main distribution, but with them
  disabled by default.  The whole division between the 6.4 series and
  the other [stable] LAM version was too confusing, anyway.  HISTORY,
  INSTALL, and RELEASE_NOTES were updated -- their 6.4 counterparts
  were merged in and the originals removed from CVS.
- Fixed some annoying ROMIO issues.
- Fixed a problem that if --prefix was not specified to configure 
  and lamtree was found in the $path, the prefix would be set to the
  directory where lamtree was found, not its parent.
- Fixed a long-standing problem with 'localhost' appearing in boot
  schemas with multiple hosts.  If the origin node in a boot schema
  resolves to 127.0.0.1 and there is more than one node in the boot
  schema, a warning is displayed and lamboot will not attempt to 
  boot the cluster
- Removed two sections of #undef's from share/include/MPISYSF.h that
  were mistakenly left in the FORTRANUNDERSCORE case which caused
  problems with some fortran compilers (e.g., Absoft).  Thanks to
  Ricardo Fonseca for pointing this out.
- Fixed bug in hcc that didn't check for ROMIO and MPI 2 C++ libraries
  when the prefix is /usr.  Thanks to Jean-Baptiste Cazier for
  pointing this bug.
- Found an obscure name clash with LAM's tputs() and termcap/ncurses.
  This has show up before on the LAM list (a long time ago) was was
  misdiagnosed.  The problem is that some libreadline.so's are
  compiled with a dependency for libncurses.  So even if you compile
  with "mpicc foo.c -lreadline", the linker will effectively translate
  this into "cc foo.c -lreadline ...LAM libs... -lncurses", which
  means that LAM's tputs() will get used instead of ncurses'.  To fix
  the majority of these problems, tputs() was changed to a #define in
  LAM, and the function was renamed to be lam_tputs().  This won't
  work if the user includes <tstdio.h> (a trillium header file) and
  tries to call the termcap/ncurses tputs(), but I think the chances
  of that happening are pretty darn low.  Thanks to Glenn Maynard for
  pointing this out.
- Fixed a bug in snprintf.c where %c just didn't work.  This was only
  a problem on platforms that don't have a native snprintf() function.
  Thanks to John Turner for pointing this out.
- Fix a name clash between AIX 4.3.? and LAM -- change the ALIGNMENT
  macro to LAM_ALIGNMENT.  Thanks to Jalel Chergui for pointing this out.
- Added a fix for some OS's (e.g., RH 7.1) where the CMSG_DATA macro
  in socket.h (or wherever it is actually defined) is broken for
  non-gcc compilers.  The fix is a test in configure.in and a
  workaround in share/etc/srfd.c.  Thanks to many LAM users for
  helping to locate this bug.
- Fixed a pair of bugs that were directly related to having a large
  number of nodes in the LAM universe.  mpirun had some fixed length
  strings that would be overrun for large numbers of hosts with
  "mpirun C foo", and the protocol for ldogetlinks() (internal LAM
  call to obtain the routing table from the lamd/dlo) had to be redone
  to keep the message sizes beneath MAXNMSGLEN.  See the comment in
  share/trillium/ldolinks.c.  Thanks to Jeff Oishi for letting us use
  his big cluster to track down these bugs.
- Changed the type of the first parameter to the C++ binding for
  MPI_Get_processor_name from (char*&) to (char*).
- Fixed an issue in the MPI 2 C++ bindings where linking the mpi2c++.h
  file could result in the link pointing to the wrong directory during
  make install if DESTDIR is used.  Thanks to Todd Fries for pointing
  this out.


6.5.4
-----

- Fixed problem with MPI_COMPLEX and MPI_DOUBLE_COMPLEX first posted by
  Richard Winnett.  In an heterogenous environment, LAM was not
  properly byte-swapping the datatype.
- Fixed problem with -lutil not being added to the arguments list
  passed by mpi{cc,CC,f77} to the underlying compiler when needed for
  pty support.  Thanks to Gordon Gere for the inital post about the
  bug on the LAM mailing list.


6.5.3
-----

- The ROMIO library was being installed under the wrong name.  This
  was a problem because mpicc/mpif77 check for the presence of the
  library before linking to them with -l.  Hence, mpicc/mpif77
  effectively ignored the ROMIO library, even if LAM was compiled with
  ROMIO support.  Thanks to Jay for bringing this to our attention.
- The LAM-specific MPIL_* man pages are now installed properly.
  Thanks to Aaron Fein for pointing out this problem.
- Fixed some problems with ROMIO's build/installation procedure when
  using a VPATH build.  libmpio.a was previously built in the source
  tree, not the build tree (among other things).
- Fixed an issue with duplicate symbols when compiling either of the
  shmem RPIs as shared libraries with some linkers.  Thanks to Ferenc
  Tamas Gyurcsan and Camm Maguire for pointing this out.
- If $prefix is /usr and we're not building LAM, don't -I/usr/include
  and -L/usr/lib in hcc/hf77.  This causes problems for some linux
  distrubitions, because it disrupts the natural search order of
  include/library directories (particularly when mixed with C++ header
  files).  Thanks to Trond Eivind Glomsrod for pointing this out.


6.5.2
-----

- Fixed two problems in the ROMIO installation: 1) where all files
  under $prefix/lib would be set to permissions 0755, and 2) ROMIO was
  overwriting several LAM man pages (MPI_Info_* and two MPI_Type_*
  files).  Thanks to multiple LAM users for pointing this out (tthomas
  and David Shattuck, especially).
- Fixed a problem in the MPI-2 C++ bindings installation where mpi++.h
  could get linked to the wrong place under a certain set of
  circumstances.  Thanks to Todd Fries for pointing this out.


6.5.1
-----

- Fixed a stupid configure test that prevented pty support from
  working properly under Linux.  Thanks to JeongYeop Kim for initially
  pointing this out to us.
- Fixed initializer for the MPI::DOUBLE_INT constant in the C++
  bindings.  Thanks to Gustavo Romero Lopez for pointing this out.


6.5
---

- Fixed problems on some OS's (cough cough HP-UX cough cough) where
  telling the kenyad to detach a process that was loaded via the flatd
  would try to call unlink() and fail becuase the process was actually
  still running (on most OS's this is fine).  Now we defer the detach
  and unlink() procedure until the died catches the child's death.
- Fixed problem with Fortran version of MPI_STATUS_IGNORE and
  MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE.  Thanks to John Pormann for pointing this out.
- Added the environment variable LAM_MPI_SOCKET_SUFFIX that will allow
  the same user to run multiple lamd's on the same node.  This is a
  generalization of the extension for PBS for the "overlapping LAM"
  problem.
- Added a "-s" option to lamboot that will force the closing of
  stdout/stderr of the locally-launched lamd.  Normally, the
  stdout/stderr of the local lamd is left open so that tstdio(3) will
  work properly.  Using -s will break tstdio(3), but this isn't a
  great loss because most people don't use it anyway.  :-) Using -s
  will allow things like the following to work:
       rsh somenode lamboot -s hostfile
  Since rsh waits for two conditions to complete: lamboot to finish,
  and stdout/stderr to close.  Without -s, stdout/stderr would not
  close, and rsh would hang.  Thanks to John Turner and Nina Thiessen
  for suggesting this.
- Added man pages for all MPI-1 and MPI-2 functions.
- Changed from the lamboot bootschema ":num" syntax to "cpu=num"
  syntax because of potential abbiguity problems with IPv6 addresses.
  This also changed the "username" optional argument to become
  "username=foo".  Jeremiah Willcock donated the parsing code in
  share/boot/bhostparse.c for this.  <later> After a bunch of
  discussion, we preserved backward compatibility; if the first word
  after a hostname has no "=" in it, it is treated as the username.
- Fixed a problems on BSD machines where ROMIO incorrectly used the
  preprocessor symbol PVFS to determine if the PVFS filesystem was
  installed or not.  On BSD machines, PVFS is #define'd to some kind
  of priority in <sys/param.h>; it has nothing to do with whether the
  PVFS filesystem is installed or not.  So all instances in ROMIO were
  changed to ROMIO_HAVE_PVFS.
- MPIL_Spawn (which is deprecated, anyway) and MPI_Comm_spawn (when
  used with an appschema) did not automatically export LAM_MPI_*
  environment variables.  This has been fixed.
- Fixed error code reporting and problems with the root rank still
  using maxprocs when the MPI_Info key "file" was used.  Thanks to Le
  Dinh An for pointing out this problem.
- Added some more example programs: alltoall (C), pi (C and fortran),
  and ring (C).
- Added more tests to the lamtests package.  Also added ability for
  user to setenv CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to pass in arbitrary flags to the
  compile/link process.
- Gave ROMIO the ability to set the number of bytes received in a LAM
  MPI_Status object.  Otherwise, calling MPI_Get_count on a MPI_Status
  that was returned from a ROMIO function would give erroneous
  (random!)  results.  Thanks to Nina Thiessen for bringing this to
  our attention.
- Fixed a crazy error that only seems to happen on AIX 4.3.3 that has
  to do with blocking vs. non-blocking sockets in the TCP RPI's (and
  the others that derived from the TCP RPI).  fcntl() didn't seem to
  work properly when attempting to switch between
  blocking/non-blocking modes on the socket, so ioctl(fd, FIONBIO,
  &flag) is now used on systems where FIONBIO is defined (seems pretty
  portable, though).  Note that there are other places where we use
  fcntl() -- they may need to be updated to ioctl/FIONBIO as well.
  Thanks to Shahryar Nikandish for pointing this out, and the cast of
  thousands who helped resolve it (literally; there were too many
  people and too many e-mails to list here).
- Added the use of the openpty() for -pty support to mpirun under
  Linux.
- Added prototypes for MPI_Op_f2c and MPI_Op_c2f in <mpi.h> (they were
  missing).  Thanks to Anthony Chan for pointing this out.
- Fixed some environment variable issues in hboot, lamboot, recon, and
  wipe.  Thanks to William Yu for pointing this out.
- Sped up lamboot, recon, and wipe by removing frequently-unnecessary
  second rsh (used to determine if the user has the bourne shell, in
  which case .profile must be executed manually).  This can be invoked
  with the "-b" option to lamboot/recon/wipe.  Bourne and Korn shell
  users (*not* including bash users) cannot use the "-b" switch.
- Added XMPI_Buoy(), XMPI_Coloron(), and XMPI_Coloroff() functions for
  additional XMPI control.  See their respective man pages for details.
- Added some missing quotes in lamtests/make-defs that prevented the
  tests from running under some picky shells.
- Change to print entire error messages out in stderr, not just the
  top and bottom bars, or the potential "I can't find the help file"
  message.  Thanks to Karganov Konstantin for pointing this out.
- Fixed some 64-bit casting issues in share/etc/ttime.c (i.e.,
  MPI_WTIME); probably not strictly necessary, but it can't hurt.
  Thanks to Jeff Bachtel for pointing this out.
- Moved the LAM version number to $top_srcdir/VERSION, and trigger
  share/include/mpif.h and share/include/patchlevel.h from it.
  patchlevel.h is only left there for third party tools that use it to
  determine LAM's version number.
- Closed duplicated unix file socket descriptors when the lamd forks
  off a new process (e.g., via mpirun).  This wasn't technically a
  leak, since it didn't introduce any new file descriptors into the
  OS, but it wasn't Right, either.
- Added more verbose error messages for errors during MPI_INIT,
  particularly those dealing with the lamd.  Made the routines for
  finding the helpfile a bit more robust, particularly in pathalogic
  situations.
- Caused fortran versions of MPI_INIT and MPI_INIT_THREAD to forge
  argv[0] so that libraries like MPE have some nice program name to
  generate output files to.  Thanks to Anthony Chan for pointing this
  out.  
- Ensured that all files used internally by LAM are opened with secure
  permissions (i.e., don't rely on the user's umask).  And since some
  OS's (cough cough Solaris cough cough) don't want to abide by the
  umask when one opens a named unix socket, moved all LAM
  internal/temporary files to their own locked directory.
- Added a small bit in mpi.h to ensure that LAM_BUILDING is always
  defined before we use #if !LAM_BUILDING and it is not defined, gcc
  2.95.2 will give a warning if you compile with -Wundef.  Thanks to
  Frits Kuijlman for pointing this out.
- Added some syslog calls to the lamd when launched via "lamboot -d
  per suggestion from Balasubramanian Sundaram.  Messages are logged
  with a LOG_INFO severity.
- Fixed logic with --with-rsh when used with non-absolute filenames.
  Thanks to Frits Kuijlman for pointing this out.
- Made "there is no lamd running" error messages more user-friendly
  and descriptive.  Applied these messages to all the LAM/MPI
  executables and to MPI_Init.
- Added some ACK code to share/etc/srfd.c to fix a race condition on
  some operating systems (e.g., SCO) such that sending file descriptor
  messages to another process could get buffered and then discarded
  (before the receiver got the messages) when the pipe was closed.
  Making the sender wait for the receiver's ACK solves this problem.
  Thanks to Keith Pereira for a **large** number of e-mails to figure
  this problem out.
- Changed LAM_CHECK_PROTOS to use $CPPFLAGS instead of $CFLAGS.  In
  some cases, this would pass things like "-O" to /lib/cpp, which
  would abort and therefore configure would think that the prototype
  did not exist (regardless of whether it did or not).  Thanks to Chan
  Siu Pang for pointing this out.
- Add -DSVR4 to CFLAGS when compiling under SCO.  Thanks to Keith
  Pereira for pointing this out.
- Fixed some race conditions in share/boot/inetexec.c that sometimes
  caused lamboot to fail seemingly without reason.  It was really due
  to a mixture of bad logic dealing with stderr closing, or select()
  getting interrupted by SIGCHLD (i.e., the child died before all the
  output was read), and we forgot to check for EINTR.  Oops.  Thanks
  to Eray Ozkural and Camm Maguire for initially pointing this out
  (http://www.jp.debian.org/Bugs/db/65/65795.html), and big thanks to
  John Bartelt and Seth Hettich for both finally figuring out what the
  problem was and providing patience and a test bed to get the code
  "just right".
- Made some changes to the build/run process in the lamtests suite to
  make it much easier to run with a different implementation of MPI.
- Changed some MPI_Send/MPI_Recv pairs in the lamtests suite to
  MPI_Sendrecv.  It seems that some users are using the lamtests suite
  for other MPI implementations (MPICH/gm), and they were deadlocking
  (assumedly, MPICH/gm has a pretty small "small" message size).
  Thanks to Troy Baer for pointing this out.
- When checking the value of MPI_TAG_UB in the lamtests, if you're not
  using LAM/MPI, it now only prints a warning if the value that is
  obtained is not what is expected.  Gotta love that LAM_MPI
  preprocessor symbol!  Thanks for Troy Baer for pointing this out.
- Fixed what looked like a simple problem in tping (it wasn't) where
  the wrong number of nodes would be printed for various node
  specifications on the command line.
- Added/cleaned up some man pages, specifically with respect to
  new commands, deprecated commands, etc.
- Fixed problem with --with-lamd-* parameters not getting propogated
  down to their respective .c files correctly.
- Fixed problem in lamhalt to repeatedly use nid_get() instead of
  ldogetlinks() so that lamhalt will operate properly when a lamd
  prematurely dies (provided that lamboot was invoked with the -x
  fault tolerance option).
- Removed -Wall from ROMIO's configure when on Linux (it didn't check
  whether the compiler was gcc or not; it was simpler just to remove it
  altogether).
- Moved lam_init_comm_world from share/mpi/init.c to
  share/mpi/laminit.c to avoid duplicate symbols when "-lpmpi -lmpi"
  and using both names MPI_Init and PMPI_Init in a single program.
  Thanks to Anthony Chan for pointing this out.
- Added the necessary magic to the "make dist" mojo to automatically
  create man pages and stick them in the distribution.  Thanks to Bill
  Gropp and the MPICH team for providing the handy program to make the
  man pages, the initial formatting, and some of the initial text in
  the MPI-1 man pages.
- Fixed type in configure.in/acconfig.h that didn't pass the value of
  LAM_HAVE_SVR4_FD_PASSING to share/include/lam_config.h properly.
  Thanks to Keith Pereira for pointing this out.
- Fixed buffer overflow in mpirun that could happen if length of all
  command line arguments to be passed to ranks was too long.
- Changed the checks for "-lsocket -lnsl" from architecture-dependant
  stuff to use the real AC_CHECK_LIB tests.  Thanks to Keith Pereira
  for pointing out that other OS's besides Solaris require "-lsocket
  -lnsl".
- Changed some paramter types from (char), (short), and others to
  (int)/(unsigned int) in varargs situations since C promotes all
  arugments to integers anyway.  Thanks to Trond Glomsrd for
  pointing this out.
- Added uninstall target to ROMIO.
- Updated INSTALL reflect the fact that ROMIO does not obey
  configure's --foo switches regarding specific directory placement
  (e.g., "--libdir").  The ROMIO authors have been notified of this
  issue.  Thanks to Trond Glomsrd for pointing this out.
- Ditch mktemp in favor of mkstemp because of a possible race
  condition in mktemp (thanks to the OpenBSD gcc for pointing this
  out. :-)
- Make singleton init processes start with the RTF_MPIC2C flag, mainly
  so that they can MPI_Comm_connect/MPI_Comm_accept to most processes
  launched by mpirun (which are -c2c by default).  Thanks to Scott
  Wilcox for pointing this out.
- Changed MPI_Initialized to always return 1 after calling MPI_Init,
  per MPI-1.2 (instead of returning 0 after calling MPI_Finalize).
  Thanks to Jeremiah Willcock for pointing this out.
- Added MPI_Finalized.
- Expanded error message for calling MPI functions before MPI_Init,
  and added error message for calling MPI functions after
  MPI_Finalize.
- Changed some of the lamtests to alloc memory from the heap and not
  try to statically allocate it on the stack.  Thanks to James Lupo
  for pointing out that this had problems on at least Alpha/OSF 4.0a.
- Added some missing MPIL_ #defines for profiling.
- Added MPI_Alloc_mem and MPI_Free_mem, mainly in anticipation of
  their use with the Myrinet and VIA RPIs.
- Added optional RPI calls _rpi_c2c_alloc_mem and _rpi_c2c_free_mem to
  support MPI_Alloc_mem and MPI_Free_mem.  If the RPI does not supply
  them, they will be wrappers to malloc() and free().
- Changed share/mpi/lamcid.c to maintain a bitmap of used communicator
  IDs.  Still use the "take the highest unclaimed CID" algorithm, but
  when we COMM_FREE a communicator, we set the corresponding bit to 0.
  Hence, you can reclaim CIDs, particularly for 3rd party libraries
  that make a bunch of communicators and then free them all.  Thanks
  to Ed D'Azevedo for pointing this out.
- Had to add some automake_bogosity.h files in random places around
  the LAM source tree so that "make depend" would work properly (they
  have no other purpose.  This is a problem with automake 1.4 -- hope
  it gets fixed in automake 1.5.
- Similarly, there are a few automake_bogosity.c files around the tree
  for similar reasons (library linking is broken in automake 1.4 unless
  there is at least one .c file -- hope that this, too, gets fixed in
  automake 1.5).
- Fixed sfh_sock_open_clt_unix_stm() to not loop upon ECONNREFUSED or
  ETIMEDOUT to fix "hang" behavior on Linux when invoking a LAM
  command with no lamd running (thanks to Joe Griffin for pointing
  this out).  
- Fixed overlapping errno/LAM error numbers and strange behavior of
  strerror() on Linux in terror.c routines.
- Moved all RPI code into its own subdirectory tree (share/rpi), and
  made each RPI be its own convenience library (sort of).  This
  greatly cleaned up the automake ugliness of getting the RPI code to
  be selected by configure and yet compile into the same library
  (while still doing dependencies properly).
- Added check in configure for <strings.h>, and appropriate #if
  statements in various .c files (thanks to Dave Hassett).
- Added --with-romio-flags switch for configure (thanks to Christophe
  Prud'homme for requesting this).
- Added 2 patches to ROMIO distribution from
  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/romio/patch.html; one for a seg fault in
  collective reads and writes, another for a problem with the pvfs
  implementation (thanks to Christophe Prud'homme for pointing this
  out).  Added romio/README_LAM to note which ROMIO patches have been
  added.
- Added some (void*) casting magic to eliminate some compiler warnings
  and [unlikely] potential problems on 64 bit problems.
- Ensured that compiler flags from configure get passed down to the
  examples (a helpful LAM user pointed this out, but I've lost his
  name!).
- Fixed a gradual memory leak in various MPI_*_c2f functions -- the
  fortran handles were never freed in the corresponding MPI_*_free
  functions (thanks to Richard Day for pointing this out).
- MPI_Request_c2f just didn't work; fixed (thanks to Richard Day for
  pointing this out).
- Fix problem in MPI_Info_get where valuelen<strlen(result), LAM
  would shave off an extra character, contrary to MPI-2 4.10.
- Fix problem with clash of system events with -getpid()
  synchronization.  <much later> Now we *really* fixed it, by
  reserving events 0x40000000 and above, as well as all negative
  events (negative events were already reserved) for nsend and
  friends.  This will only affect people using the API below MPI
  (i.e., native LAM stuff).  Also, all the events in <events.h>
  changed; this definitely breaks backwards binary compatability
  (although I think it's already broken because of CPU counts during
  lamboot, for example).
- Fix for "Interrupted system call" errors during process startup. 
- Can specify a hostname more than once in a boot schema, or have
  ":num" suffix on a hostname, where "num" is a number specifiying how
  many CPUs are available for use on that host.  If the ":num" suffix
  is not used, ":1" is assumed.  If a hostname is listed more than
  once, the CPU count for that host is incremented by the CPU count on
  that line.  This is particularly useful in batch systems (e.g.,
  PBS), where the hostfile provided by the batch may list a hostname
  more than once (indicating mulitple CPUs have been scheduled for the
  job).
  --> This comment is somewhat superceded by a comment above -- changed
      away from the ":num" syntax to a "cpu=num" syntax.
- Per above bullet, introduced "C" and "cX" notation in mpirun and
  appschemas.  "mpirun C foo" will run one instance of "foo" on every
  available CPU.  "mpirun c0-3 foo" will run one instance of "foo" on
  CPUs numbered 0 through 3.  Ranks in MPI_COMM_WORLD will be adjacent
  on machines with multiple CPUs.  For example, 2 on 4-way SMPs,
  "mpirun C foo" will place ranks 0-3 on n0, and 4-7 on n1.
- -np now also schedules per CPU (vs. per node).  So if you have
  lambooted on 2 4-way SMPs and "mpirun -np 6 foo", ranks 0-3 will be
  on n0, and 4-5 will be on n1.
- MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE will now report the total CPU count, not the total
  node count.
- Re-discovered MPI_Info key for spawn: file.  Allows users to pass in
  an appschema.  This has existed for some time, but was not
  documented.
- Changed spawn and spawn_multiple to pass along LAM_MPI_* (and
  associated) environment variables automatically.  Necessary for
  doing unique unix socket names in batch environments, actually.
- Added "lamnodes" command to retrieve hostnames from LAM nX
  nomenclature.
- Added "lamhalt" command to shut down LAM.  This command replaces
  the "wipe" command (we've always hated that name, anyway!).  lamhalt
  does not require a boot schema (hostfile) to shutdown LAM, and is
  much faster than wipe.  Everyone should use lamhalt instead of wipe.
- Fixed "overlapping LAM" problem for batch systems.  When running
  under a batch system (PBS is currently the only one supported), LAM
  will now use the batch job ID as part of the local unix socket names
  in /tmp.  This allows the scheduler to place multiple LAM/MPI jobs
  from the same user on a single node (e.g., for SMP runs) without
  hosing any previous instances of the LAM daemon.
- Make wrapper compilers handle -lpmpi properly.  Still need to
  manually specify -lpmpi for ROMIO jobs.
- Updated MPI 2 C++ to verson 1.0.6.
- No longer install all the Trillium .h files by default.  They are
  not required for correct MPI use (which is the vast majority of
  LAM/MPI usage, anyway), and can cause name conflicts in the
  $(includedir).  The --with-trillium configure flag is provided to
  still install these files, if desired.
- Build the profiling layer in MPI by default (ROMIO works nicer that
  way, actually).  Added --without-profile configure switch to turn it
  off, but it will complain/barf if you do --with-romio (default) and
  --without-profile.
- Made builds of ROMIO and MPI-2-C++ a bit more robust from the top --
  won't reconfigure/rebuild every time you "make".
- Fixed share/args/snprintf.c and share/tstdio/tprint.c to have a few
  casts when dealing with varargs kinds of things; allows LAM to
  compile under LinuxPPC (thanks to Tom Rini).
- Made lamd default values --with switches to configure, and moved
  them to acconfig.h, instead of having -D switches to the compile
  line.
- Made -DSHORTCIRCUIT the default, moved it to acconfig.h instead of a
  compile line switch.
- Updated ROMIO to version 1.0.2, and made --with-romio the default.
- Renamed all LAM libraries to have a "lam" prefix (except libmpi.a
  and libpmpi).  Consolidated all auxilary LAM libraries into
  liblam.a.  Fixed up wrapper compilers to match.
- Improved some of the error/help messages in mpirun.
- Moved default location of installed schema files to
  $prefix/share/lam/.
- Moved default location of installed lam-helpfile to
  $prefix/share/lam/lam-helpfile.
- The values from configure that were put in share/include/rpi.*.h are
  now put in share/include/lam_config.h.  Fixed some problems with
  those substitutions, too.
- Renamed share/h to share/include (finally!).
- Used automake's integrated libtool functionality to build everything.
- Fully automake-ized the build process; now we have separated "make
  all" and "make install" (finally!).  Also have VPATH build ability
  (which took a lot more effort than it should have!).
- Added note in lam_printfunc() that the rank displayed is relative to 
  MPI_COMM_WORLD. 
- Fixed MPIL_Spawn to use the new startup protocols (thanks to Gyurcsan
  Ferenc Tamas).
- Updated config.guess and config.sub from the latest autoconf
  distribution (2.13) to recognize a few more flavors of Linux (thanks
  to Camm Maguire).
- "-pty", pseudo tty support, is now on by default.  Use "-npty" to
  disable


6.4a8 (6.5.1)
-------------

- NOTE: This marks the end of the 6.4 series.  All future IMPI HISTORY
  items will be in the main [stable] 6.5 series, starting with 6.5.2.
- Critical bug fix, corresponding to LAM 6.5.1


6.4a7 (6.5)
-----------

- Fixed issues with overtaking messages/violations of MPI's message
  ordering guarantee when you mix long and short messages with the
  same signature through the IMPI host.  Thanks to CQ from HP for
  pointing this out.
- Fixed problem with DATASYNC and SYNCACK pings from the impid to the
  LAM rank potentially getting mixed up.  Thanks to CQ from HP for
  pointing this out.
- Changed IMPI hiwater/ackmark behavior to adhere to the new specs in
  the errata IMPI version 0.0 (i.e., one global hiwater/ackmark, not
  per host pair).
- Ditched the "-" in the 6.4a4 version number.  Makes it easier for
  the distribution generating scripts.  :-)
- Automatically export IMPI_* environment variables from mpirun to the
  running jobs
- Fixed some endian problems between machines with opposite endians.
- Added functionality for MPI_Barrier, MPI_Reduce, and MPI_Allreduce.
- Automake-ized along with the rest of LAM (6.5).
- Fixed numerous endian problems in the IMPI client code in the impid.
- Added four predefined keys on MPI_COMM_WORLD: IMPI_CLIENT_SIZE,
  IMPI_CLIENT_COLOR, IMPI_HOST_SIZE, IMPI_HOST_COLOR, per IMPI
  standard Section 2.5.


6.4a4 through 6.4a6
-------------------

- Internal releases.  Minor compile/testing issues fixed, nothing
  really of interest.  They were only separate releases so that they
  could be shared with external parties.  End results are discussed in
  6.4a7 section, above.


6.4-a3 (6.3.2)
--------------

- Critical bug fix, corresponding to LAM 6.3.2.


6.4-a2 (6.3.1)
--------------

- Only the following MPI communications functions are supported in
  IMPI jobs:
    MPI_Send*, MPI_*send*, MPI_Recv*, MPI_*recv*
    MPI_Wait*, MPI_Test*
    MPI_Barrier
- No IMPI-wide collectives other than MPI_Barrier have been
  implemented. 
- IMPI communicator attribute colors (per IMPI 2.5) are not
  implemented. 
- First release to the world.


6.4-a1
------

- Internal ND IMPI release, separate from the stable LAM series.  Too
  ugly to talk about.  :-)


6.3.2
-----

- Fixed syncronization issues with sysv and usysv RPI's that could
  cause corrupted data on a reciever.


6.3.1
-----

- Discovered/worked around bug in autoconf such that AC_PROG_CC
  blindly changes the value of CFLAGS.


6.3
---

- Updated the MPI-2-C++ package to version 1.0.5.
- Added LAM_MAJOR_VERSION, LAM_MINOR_VERSION, LAM_RELEASE_VERSION
  constants (both in C and Fortran) to allow checking of versions of
  executables and libraries, etc.  Particularly for the case where
  users have old copies of mpif.h in their cwd and wonder why LAM/MPI
  seems to stop working when they upgrade.


6.3-b3
------

- Fixed problem in share/mpi/accept.c and share/mpi/connect.c where
  connect.c wasn't calling nrecv() for the right node; it incorrectly
  used nh_node to identify the sender.  Fixed the sender to put its
  nodeid in nh_data[0] so that we can properly identify the sender.
- Added some more LAM_ZERO_ME's into the lamd.
- Fixed up the distscript.csh to also create .bz2 versions of LAM
  tarballs (thanks to Nicholas McGuire).
- Fixed problem where $(CFLAGS) and $(FFLAGS) were not getting used
  when building the "trivial" example.
- Fixed obscure problems with data packing -- discovered via the
  ScaLAPACK test suite (thanks to Camm Maguire).
- Renamed the drop-in replacement for snprintf() to be lam_snprintf().
  This should fix some of those seg faults on OS's that claim not to
  have snprintf(), but really do (only matters when printing
  diagnostic and help messages).
- Fixed problem with fortran attributes in deprecated function
  MPI_ATTR_GET in 64 bit environments per MPI-2 section 4.12.7.


6.3-b2
------

- Fix MPI_Cart_sub for case where remain_dims array is all falses.
- Found obscure race condition in lamd, in which a read from
  unallocated error, if timed badly (really -- don't ask) would cause
  Bad Things (otb/sys/filed/fqsimplex.c:fqrmfd()).
- Fixed some small (but addative) memory leaks in the lamd.  
- Added some --with-purify things to the lamd to aid in debugging.
- Changed the type of ki_jobid to be struct jobid_t, which contains 2
  int4s: the PID and the nodeid.  This allows using the full size of
  the PID, and avoids only using the lower 15 bits of the PID (which
  was causing problems on some OS's).  mpirun (and all other
  job-launching files) were changed to accomodate this.
- Check for snprintf prototype in ./configure so that we can be -Wall
  clean
- Added endian swapper for the mandelbrot example for the rasterfile
  file header, so that little endian machines can dump out a proper sun
  rasterfile.
- Added "'s in the hcp script so that we can have multi-word C++
  compilers and not crash the hcp script (doh!).
- Made LAM and MPI 2 C++ bindings -Wall clean (can't speak for ROMIO,
  but their next release should be much cleaner), and *wow* were there
  many warnings in the lamtests package...
- Fixed slight spec bug in MPI::Get_error_string(), as pointed out by
  Bill Gropp.
- Verified LAM in 64 bit (Solaris 7); added docs to advise users who
  want this to use --with-cflags='-xarch=v9' --with-ldflags='-xarch=v9'
  (in addition to any other flags that they want).
- Moved all the getsockopt/setsockopt stuff into a single file.
- Somehow the sysv RPI got eliminated from the list of valid RPI's to
  use the SHORTCIRCUIT optimization.  Put it back in configure.in.
- Put in fix for the shared memory RPIs to take care of the case where
  the processes sharing a shared memory area happen to map it in at
  different base addresses.  Have seen this a few times on a
  multi-processor Sun E6000.
- Added extra strings to the lamboot/wipe banners indicating if IMPI,
  C++, and/or ROMIO support was compiled in.
- Had to do some major cleanup in the C++ bindings to meet new Solaris
  Workshop C++ compiler pickyness.  (void*) is evil!!  Also had to
  extern "C" {} signal handlers and other C intercept functions.
- Added "#define LAM_MPI 1" to <mpi.h>, for those users who need to
  differentiate between different implementations of MPI.
- Made ./configure much more C++ friendly (in preparation for IMPI)
- Fixed problem in MPI_Accumulate where user's buffer was erroneously
  being freed (or attempting to be freed) -- just like the MPI_Put
  error that was fixed for 6.3-b1.
- Added missing lam_resetfunc() in shortcircuit MPI_Recv.
- Implicitly add "." to PATH on local/remote nodes so that we can do
  "mpirun N foo", even if "." is not in your path on the remote nodes
  (this mainly applies to the global filesystem case).
- Added LAM_ prefix to all preprocessor symbols that the user could
  clash with that are not directly from autoconf.
- Added "-d" debug message in lambootagent.c for showing exactly what
  is being executed on the local node (the message was already there
  for remote nodes; we missed the local message somehow).
- Added IMPI source code to tree, but disabled it for LAM distribution
  tarballs (makes it much easier on us developers!).
- Various enhancements to Makefile structure; use centralized
  permissions, etc.
- Smarter treatment of perror() in hcc/hf77 -- only call it if return
  status of underlying compiler != 0 and errno != 0.
- Fixed up bunches of memory leaks in MPI_Comm_spawn* (is it *that*
  obvious that we're working on IMPI?)
- Fixed bug in MPI_Comm_spawn*; app schema environment is now set to a
  dummy (empty) environment rather than NULL.
- Fixed bug in MPI_Comm_spawn*; maxprocs and array_of_errcodes is now
  broadcast to the non-root nodes (even though this doesn't make
  sense; MPI-2 88:13 says that maxprocs is only significant at the
  root, but it says that array_of_errcodes is significant everywhere).
  So this is MPI-2 conformant, but nonsensical.
- Made changes to make "mpirun N foo 'a b'" to do the Expected Thing --
  that the launched processes will get "a b" as argv[1], not "a" as
  argv[1], and "b" as argv[2].
- Changed all uses of "rm/cp" in Makefiles to use the install-sh script
- Added check in configure to see if OS defines int2, uint2, int4,
  uin4, int8, uin8, float4, and float8 before definiting them in LAM.
- Stopped making link from $prefix/include/mpi2c++/mpi++.h to
  $prefix/include, both in Makefile.in and mpi2c++/Makefile.in
  (updated mpi2c++ CVS tree as well).  Caused confusion in include
  files, because <mpi++.h> doesn't include <mpi2c++/foo.h>, it only
  includes <foo.h>.
- Fixed some g++ -Wall minor warnings in the C++ bindings (it didn't
  like the order of initializers in some constructors).  Also updated
  in the MPI 2 C++ CVS tree.
- Fixed subtle problem with using MPI_PROC_NULL when using non-blocking
  communication (such as Sendrecv).
- Removed ZERO_ME from lamreqs.c:_mpi_build_req() that was masking some
  illegitamte RUI's (such as the MPI_PROC_NULL problem)
- Fixed bizzarre snprintf error for arches/compilers that don't have
  a native snprintf (some didn't like the snprintf() wrapper to
  va_snprintf -- go figure).
- Fixed error message (for stderr output) in share/boot/inetexec.c.
- Changed hcp to search for hcc in LAMHOME, TROLLIUSHOME, $prefix, and
  $PATH (in that order) rather than just use $prefix.
- Made configure fail when it can't find a fortran compiler when
  compiling with fortran support.  Previous screwy logic made it warn,
  not fail.
- Fixed an inconsistency in share/tstdio/tfprint.c with varargs; made
  tvsprintf() and tvfprintf() have same non-K&R arg lists as all the
  other functions.


6.3-b1
------

- Changed default prefix to be /usr/local/lam-VERSION
- Made <sys/select.h> be conditionally included (HP 10.20 doesn't have
  one)
- Fixed problem in MPI_Put where user's buffer was erroneously being
  freed (or attempting to be freed)
- Fixed minor memory leak in MPI_Finalize to free user errorhandlers
  on MPI_COMM_WORLD and MPI_COMM_SELF, if they existed
- Added stolen IBM MPI test suite to CVS tree; this makes a separate
  tarball (lamtests-VERSION).  Cleaned up the tests to be bcheck -all
  clean.
- Added ability to export environment variables; all variables named
  LAM_MPI_* are exported by default (but can be disabled by mpirun),
  and via the -x option to mpirun.  Many more details in CVS logs.
- Changed behavior of -D in mpirun -- do chdir after the fork but
  before the exec in the lamd so that when the user's application
  starts, it is already in the "right" directory (i.e., it doesn't
  have to wait for MPI_INIT).  
- Added pty support.  Still experimental (sort of), so it's not the
  default in mpirun (yet).  Many more details in CVS logs.
- Fixed MPI 2 C++ bug (here and in MPI 2 C++ CVS repository) where
  $prefix directories, if created, could get incorrect Unix perms
- Made distscript much more friendly and useful; we now distribute a
  tarball with the internal LAM .h dependencies already generated
- Fixed a duplicate/bad free in share/mpi/c2cbuf.c:_cbuf_delete() for
  Issend's to MPI_PROC_SELF that had not yet had a matching receive
  posted
- Fixed some places in share/mpi/rpi.*.c:connect_all() where some OS's
  getsockopt may not set the parameter properly, causing a "read from
  uninitialized" error
- Fixed small memory leaks in share/mpi/rpi.*.c:connect_all()
- Added --with-ldflags ./configure flag; changed Makefiles (i.e., the
  LIBBIND macro) to use USER_LDFLAGS instead of CFLAGS.
- Fixed subtle bug in share/mpi/c2cbuf.c that would effect a
  duplicate/bad free in special case optimization for unmatched
  issend's in TCP RPI
- Made wipe now use the default boot schema ($LAMHOME/boot/bhost.def)
  if you do not specify a <bhost> on the command line (just like
  lamboot)
- Updated many man pages; added mpicc.1, mpiCC.1, mpif77.1, lamd.1,
  lam-helpfile.5, conf.5
- Added -H and V options to wipe for symmetry with lamboot
- Added a warning in RELEASE_NOTES that MPI_CANCEL does not cancel (or
  even attempt to cancel) sends (and the web pages)
- Added more debug messages to recon, lamboot, wipe, tkill, and hboot.
  Made existing verbose messages more descriptive; added suggested
  solutions to common problems when errors occur (prints messages from
  the ASCII help file)
- Added an ASCII help file to store common error messages
- Added --with-purify configure flag
- Added ROMIO (from http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/romio/)
- Added MPI 2 C++ bindings
- Added ability to mpirun non-LAM programs.  This rocks.
- Renamed all variables that were named "new" (still can't compile LAM
  with a C++ compiler, but it's a start)
- Fixed problem with Sun Workshop compiler not getting prototypes
- Renamed $LAMHOME/h directory to be $LAMHOME/include (with a symbolic link
  to "h" for backward compatability)
- Top level "examples" target to build LAM, MPI 2 C++, and ROMIO
  examples
- Changed docs to reflect correct e-mail addresses
- Fixed up examples codes to reflect new order of arguments in boot
  schemas
- Fixed fortran compiler problems in ./configure; ensured that
  --with-fc will propogate the fortran compiler to hf77, etc.
- Fixed warnings and __STDC__ strangeness with Sun Workshop compilers
  in the tstdio varargs functions
- Changed wrapper compilers to -I/-L/-l ROMIO and C++ bindings stuff
- Changed default make target to compile LAM and C++ bindings,
  as well as perform "make depend" if necessary.
- Added compiling the LAM specific ROMIO as a configure option.  
- Fixed subtle problem with logic in mreadv and mwritev where iov could
  end up pointing beyond its allocated memory
- ./configure now bails when common utilities (e.g., ar) are not found
- Removed mpicc/mpif77, made them symbolic links to hcc/hf77
  (respectively), and created mpiCC which is a sym link to hcp
- Wrapper compilers now get compilers that are set/used in ./configure
- Made -lmpi implicit in wrapper compilers
- Merged some makefiles to make "tags" and "cscope" targets in main
  Makefile (for development)  
- Changed the assignment of elements to/from a struct status to be a bit
  more portable (especially for the Portland Group's C/C++ compiler)
- Changed MPI_MAX_NAME_LEN to MPI_MAX_PORT_NAME to comply with MPI-2.
- Made errget.c increment the error handler's refcount.
- Made MPI_Wtime and MPI_Wtick real4 instead of double precision in mpif.h.
- Moved #include <sys/types.h> before #include <sys/signal.h> in 
  /share/mpi/lamsig.c and otb/mpirun/mpirun.c

3/1	GDB	fix	major flaw:  Floating variables "full" in all_hash.c
			and "open_desc_count" in freq library were causing
			conflicts with the shared resident library and were
			removed.  This fix resolved several small bugs.

3/1	GDB	fix	lstt/itb/Makefile and lstt/bin/Makefile did not
			propagate the GROUP macro

3/6	GDB	fix	Placed #ifdef around tools/c.h for compatibility
			with stand-alone system.  (drecv.c)

3/6	GDB	fix	Added -l option.  (bfstate.c)

3/11	RBD	fix	Added NT_CAST to typemask of getnotb macro. (net.h)

3/14	RYL	mod	Upgraded several man pages.

3/27	MB	fix	Upgraded print.c to 89.1 LSTT.  (lstt/itb/libc/stdio)

3/27	GDB	fix	Added GROUP macro defintion in lstt/itb/Makefile.

4/6	VSD	fix	Modified all *SENDRECV files in /tools/otb/libT
			and /tools/itb/libf77. Changed int ndsize to 
			int *ndsize to take care of FORTRAN-C interface.
			Made changes to ensure the same order of 
			parameters for OTB and ITB calls.

4/11	RBD	fix	In tkill: added quotes around the userid of the
			notified person so that it does not interfere 
			with the aliases in the .mailrc of the "killer".

4/26	RBD	mod	Added yywrap() in naill.l returning 1.

4/26	RBD	mod	Upgrade of spread to work also on PC Trollius.
			Disable the tkill, hboot and its trout and invoke
			tserver at the end for PCT, stay the same for Unix.
			Added -o option passing to vboot for PCT. General
			beautify for spread (comments, tabs and modularity).

4/26	RBD	mod	Added NT_ERROR, NOTTYPE and tisbad() in net.h
			to handle error conditions for the future gettype().

5/2	VSD	fix	Changed D***DATA to D***MSG for nh_msg field in
			bin/sys/dl_dev/dli_dev.c and dlo_dev.c.

5/3	GDB	fix	For some reason, RCS directories did not exist in
			tools/itb/libf77, though the RCS files did exist.

5/3	GDB	fix	Removed debris file tools/itb/libc/unix/ppdep.

5/6	RBD	mod	Added the bfprobe function and its C man-page.

5/9	GDB	fix	Removed debris file lib/h/trillium/router.h.

5/10	RBD	mod	Removed the caching code from nsend.  Routing
			caching is done by the new function getrentc.
			Getrtype was added and getroute changed.  They
			both call getrentc which invokes the router via
			getrent.  Makefiles and rreq.h were slightly
			modified for the new setup.

5/13	RBD	fix	Modified the RGETROUTE request in the router so
			that it returns route table entries as is without
			modifying the r_event field for a local node. 
			Getroute() handles the case of a local node by
			returning the destination event, and nsend() does
			not check for this condition anymore.  This solves
			a cache consistency problem in case getroute() is
			called for the local node following a getrtype() call 
			for that node.  (lib/router/router.c)

5/15	GDB	fix	Correctly set k_index in kernel descriptor upon
			re-attachment of a client process.  This was causing
			multiple calls to kinit() to fail if interspersed
			with other kernel calls.  (lib/kernel/kkenya.c)

5/16	RBD	mod	Installed the man page for getrent(), getrentc(),
			getroute() and getrtype().

5/16	GDB	mod	State prints very negative event numbers in
			hexadecimal notation.  (bin/state/state.c)

5/16	GDB	fix	Added extra reply from flatd to its client to ensure
			that the data is loaded before the client starts
			announcing the tag value.  (lib/trillium/rflat.c,
			itb/sys/flatd/flatd.c)

5/19	RBD	mod	Modified RGETROUTE in sa_rtr to handle the getrent
			functions.  It returns NOTEVENT do indicate the
			local node and NT_OTB to indicate an otb node.
			Also modified RGETNTYPE to allow true nodetype
			masking.  (bin/sys/sa_rtr/sa_rtr.c)

5/22	RBD	mod	Installed the new bfprobe.l and getrent.l man
			pages (enhanced by Ros).  Created a stub Makefile
			under man/lstt to enable installing the man pages
			with no error reports.

6/1	GDB	fix	Upgraded select() on KATTACH to use more robust
			Unix file descriptor bit masks.  This is needed by
			SunOS 4.0 and hopefully is Unix portable.
			(tools/otb/libt/kreq/clientio.udp.c)

6/1	GDB	fix	Removed stray debugging message.
			(tools/otb/libT/freq/TOPEN.c)

6/1	GDB	fix	Removed stray y.tab.h in tools/bin-mc68020/moses.

6/1	GDB	fix	Various lex and yacc files did not originally find
			their way into RCS.

6/4	GDB	fix	ITB panic now stores error code and stack location
			into onchip RAM locations noted in mareq.h.
			(lib/h/trillium/mareq.h, tools/itb/libc/etc/panic.c)

6/5	GDB	fix	Corrected invocation of intparam().
			Abided by the -i option when used with -Z.
			Reorganized the mainline so that unused files, tools
			or devices are not located.
			(tools/bin/sboot/sboot.c)

6/6	GDB	fix	Corrected error message typo in
			bin/sys/dl_dev/dli_dev.c

6/7	GDB	mod	Updated Trollius Installation Guide.
			(doc/install.doc.ps)

6/11	GDB	fix	Bufferd's calculation of total buffer space used
			now properly includes buffer descriptor size.

6/12	GDB	fix	Duplicate copy of tlib.c was removed from
			tools/lstt/bin/tlnk.

6/13	GDB	mod	Installed final upgrade to full 89.1 LSTT.
			(tools/lstt)

6/14	GDB	fix	Corrected vendor node assignment in the supplied
			NT1000 boot schemata.

6/14	GDB	fix	Moved final process termination from _kexit() to
			system dependent routine _kbail().  This solves a
			bug with stdio cleanup on otb nodes.
			(lib/kreq/kexit.c, tools/otb/libt/kreq/clientio.*.c,
			 tools/itb/libc/kreq/clientio.c,
			 itb/sys/dl_t4/clientio.c)

6/15	VSD	fix	Fixed bug in bcopy in *SENDRECV files in
			/tools/otb/libT and /tools/itb/libf77.

6/15	VSD	mod	Changed function names of all FORTRAN wrappers
			in /tools/otb/libT and /tools/itb/libf77 to
			atmost 6-letter names. All functions start with
			'I' (returning integer) or 'F' (returning double),
			and all subroutines provide 'errno'.

6/15	VSD	mod	Deleted file ATOR.c, replaced GETROUTE.c by
			GETRENT.c and included file BFPROBE.c in 
			/tools/otb/libT/nreq and /tools/itb/libf77/nreq.
			Deleted file EXIT.c in /tools/itb/libf77/unix.

6/19	RYL	mod	Upgraded several man papges.

6/20	GDB	fix	Changed NOTTYPE to NOTNODETYPE.
			(net.h, lib/rreq/getnet.c, lib/rreq/getrent.c,
			 lib/router/router.c)
			Always set errno in functions with vague return values.
			(lib/rreq/getnet.c)

6/20	GDB	fix	Detached filesys from controlling terminal to prevent
			interruption from TTIN signal.  This was causing
			things to blow up on reading from stdin.
			Solution courtesy of K-par.
			(bin/sys/filesys/filesys.c)

6/20	MB/GDB	fix	Gave proper permission bits to file created by -o.
			(bin/loadgo/loadgo.c)

6/20	GDB	fix	Added missing options to loadgo man page.

			 lib/trillium/rechod.c, lib/trillium/rflat.c)

6/25	GDB	fix	In ULS stdio, transformed exit() into fcloseall().	
			However, nobody registers fcloseall() yet as is done
			in LSTT.  (uls/itb/libc/stdio/fcloseall.c)

6/28	GDB	fix	Reversed polarity in both conditionals in sleep() to
			achieve correct behaviour.
			Bug identification courtesy of K-par.  
			(tools/itb/libc/unix/sleep.c)

07/07/88	libc/unix/malloc.c (new file)
		This file holds our new "library malloc", that efficiently
		allocates bits and pieces for an application.  It calls
		rmalloc(), but not rfree().  (The old Unidot malloc.c

		instructions for t414.  This is a new release (3.0).

09/18/88	tools/bin/tti
		Added the transputer threaded interpreter to the Trillium
		toolset.

09/19/88	*-gould, *-vax
		Removed.  These are simply copies of *-sun, which is now the
		major development platform.

09/29/88	tti/cvt.ts
		Use tti.h like every other tti source file.

09/29/88	tti/tti.h
		Use a local copy of T414.h.  This makes tti a stand-alone tool.

09/30/88	tti/
		Moved tti to the tools/itb directory from the tools/bin
		directory.

10/26/88	terror.h
		Added EINTR to support signal delivery in a new kernel.

11/17/88	terror.h, terror.c
		changed obsolete ENOTINFO to ENOKERNEL


1.0
---

??/??/??	some Makefile change somewhere -- we forgot where or
		what it was  (update:  It might be libvpu/Makefile.)

01/05/88	setpri.c
		moved the workspace pointer way out so that the stopp
		doesn't trash a (possibly) valid stack frame.

01/11/88	conf.y/tokens.l
		make the booters abort on a syntax error

01/11/88	tkill
		fixed a silly error with the verbose flag.  The internal
		variable "Kflag" was often unset causing the script to
		abort with an undefined variable.

01/12/88	kipc.c
		Added a few more comments.

01/12/88	kernel.c
		Fixed the bug that had the kernel returning ENOEVENT when the
		event table filled up with vacant descriptors.

01/14/88	crt0.c
		Set _wp to the correct value.

01/26/88	uf/
		Installed update received from the Penguin.

01/27/88	incl/
		Installed update received from the Penguin.

01/27/88	libuls/
		Installed update received from the Penguin.
		This only consisted of adding the new file uf77io.c
		which is much different (smaller and looks like older code)
		than the same file in libf77.  It isn't used by anybody
		but it's stuck in there anyways.

01/28/88	fp/
		Installed update received from the Penguin.
		This involved many new files, mostly enhancements to
		double precision operations.  Also, frel.ts became
		obsolete.  It remains in the RCS directory but is not
		checked out and does not come with most source releases.

01/29/88	itb/gnat/, itb-0123/gnat/, itb-3210/gnat/
		Installed our nifty little demo for using the rspawn()
		routine.

01/29/88	tools/bin/tcc/gentp
		Finally installed the updated code generator from the update
		tape from the Penguin.

02/01/88	libvpu/
		The FPS C00 math library resides here.  Most of this stuff
		is straight out of the can from FPS.  In pb.ts, we poll
		for completion of the vector operation instead of interrupt.
		In extdefs.c we can't use their declaration of the parameter
		blocks because we don't use their relocation pass with the
		backend tools.

02/01/88	mldefs.h
		We have a special define for the parameter blocks to locate
		them on-chip.

02/01/88	itb/vpu/
		Added two VPU demo programs, pbtest.c for parameter block
		usage and gentest.c for generic routine usage.

02/08/88	libm/pow.c libm/sqrt.c
		Changed _pow to pow.  I have no idea why it was _pow.
		I guess something else will break now...

>>>Ultix1.2a and T40 problems found at MTU<<<

02/08/88	libuls/ctim.c
		Changed timezone to timzone to make cc happy.

02/10/88	lots of Makefiles in ,,,/bin/,,, and ,,,/bin-vax/,,,
		Nixed -L option to search directories for libraries.
		Even Ultrix 2.0 doesn't have this option for ld.
		The -L option was removed from the affected Makefiles
		and replaced by the full pathname of the library.
		This never amounted to more than "../lib/libx.ta" for
		example.  The gould and sun Makefiles were left alone.
		They can be changed as source Makefiles are copied to
		the object directories in the course of normal development.

02/10/88	confs/Q/Makefile, confs/S/Makefile
		Rewrote to take care of two problems.  First, Ultrix
		"install" won't take a directory as the target for a shell
		script.  Second, we were freezing before installing and
		that's just dumb.

02/12/88	libvpu/Makefile
		This Makefile had never been tested on a clean box.  The
		problem centered around the automatically generated
		pb_entry.h which was not installed prioir to a make depend
		or compilation of libvpu.  It has been substantially
		rewritten.

02/12/88	tlorder/Makefile
		Same "install" problem as above.

02/12/88	lboot
		Changed to boot out link 2 instead of link 1.
		This change is needed for multi-cabinet configurations.

02/12/88	conf.L
		Bumped up the stacksize of bootd.  Completely
		rearranged the loop datalink servers.  Upstream
		is link 2, downstream is link 1.  This is due to
		the way system boards are actually wired up - we
		must boot the next module in the *same* cabinet
		first.

02/13/88	router.c
		Is_downstream was not normalizing the system node
		field before calculating the loop offset.  Definitely
		wrong, but forgiven on a T20.

02/15/88	h/fps/Makefile
		T.h, a symbolic link, needed to be "touch"ed after
		installation.  Otherwise the modified date of the
		link target remains unchanged and all relevant Makefiles
		check the target date and not the link itself.  Ergo,
		the recompilations to not fire.

02/15/88	tkill/Makefile
		Tkill and sakill are shell scripts and the Makefile's
		install commands had the same Ultrix problem as the
		conf/ Makefiles noted above.

02/15/88	bootd/boot.h, bootd/image.c
		Several major blunders in bootd prohibited T40 system
		ring booting.

02/24/88	newfish/fish.c
		A typo caused the device pathname to be null.  Open
		caused a segmentation fault on Ultrix 1.2A.

03/30/88	conf.S
		Same as conf.L above.  Whoops!  Forgot to do this
		earlier.  That is why the initial T100 test at FPS
		did not work.

>>>libm was in poor shape<<<

02/11/88	libm/sqrt.c
		mb: Rewrote completely: does NOT call pow().
		Does range reduction to (0.5,2.0] and then
		uses Heron's (?) iterative procedure (faster).

02/11/88	libm/ipow.c
		errno set if exponent negative

02/11/88	libm/pow.c
		pow(): calls powi() if y is an integer (faster)
		pow(): error if x<0 && y not an integer
		_powi(): renamed powi()
		powi(): uses the algorithm from ipow() (faster)
		_ipow(): removed (there is an ipow() in ipow.c)

02/11/88	libm/floor.c
		changed "y = x - n;" (wrong!) to "y = n;"

02/11/88	libm/ceil.c
		changed "y = x - n;" (wrong!) to "y = n;"

02/11/88	libm/frac.c
		mb: rewritten with different definition for function:
		frac(123.4) is now 0.4, frac (-123.4) is -0.4.

02/11/88	libm/fabs.c
		mb: rewritten: simply zap the sign bit (much faster).
		Note that this is nonportable, since we need to know
		where the sign bit is.

02/11/88	libm/log.c
		errno set if argument nonpositive

>>><<<

02/13/88	man/
		Changed the Makefile to properly create the manl
		directory on a clean machine.  It appears that
		Ultrix man will not look in manl.  If you got an
		Ultrix machine, we recommend you copy the whole
		show to man9 (or alter the Makefile accordingly).
		Also, nothing in man was under RCS, a wrong which
		has now been righted.

02/19/88	vboot/pack_argv.c vboot/Makefile
		Removed pack_argv.c since it is available from the
		"args" library.

02/24/88	unix/mkdir.c
		Repaired a syntax error.  Who knows how it ever compiled
		before?

02/24/88	bin/buffer/buffer.c
		Rewrote the printing routine to display information on
		buffers in a fashion more understandable to the user.

02/24/88	kpar_He.c, kpar_Na.c, kpar_Fe.c
		Added new support for lightweight processes.

02/25/88	kpar_He.c, kpar_Na.c, kpar_Fe.c
		...and already they're busted.  Parameters were being
		pushed in the wrong order.

02/29/88	kenyad/pdoom.c kenyad/pstate.c
		Neither state nor doom would work with processes not
		attached to kenyad.  The problem was an uninitialized flag.

03/03/88	lib/h/trillium/Makefile, lib/h/trillium/NET.h
		A barebones (another word for Fortran) version of net.h
		was added for f77 support.

03/03/88	libf77/Makefile, libf77/unix/
		Added a new directory called unix as in libc.
		A place was needed for getpid() and exit().

03/04/88	maconfig.h
		We forgot to leave five slices of memory available at the
		top of RAM for use by the VPU library.  It had not caused
		a problem since nobody had ever allocated all of bank A0.

03/04/88	rflat.c
		The type field, used to ensure proper sequencing, was not
		properly set.

03/05/88	mldefs.h, extdefs.c
		A few VPU variables were still left in off-chip RAM instead
		of being #defined to their proper locations in on-chip RAM.

03/07/88	maconfig.h
		No allowance was made for a partially used bitmap word.

03/07/88	mallocd.c
		When searching across regions, do_malloc() was trying to
		free a null sized chunk, a dangerous practice in some cases.

03/07/88	libc/unix/Makefile, libc/nreq/Makefile, libtrillium/Makefile,
		lib/trillium, lib/nreq,
		We moved rmalloc and set_order to libc to support the
		kpar calls.

03/07/88	tools/qlt/driver-vax/ultrix-1.2/
		This is the result of the first Ultrix install.

>>>Problems found at FPS<<<

03/14/88	confs/*/Makefile
		Some of the Makefiles for the conf files still did not
		specify the full destination file for install.

03/14/88	libstdio/Makefile
		The actions for install were commented out.

03/14/88	tools/otb/nreq/Makefile
		VPATH had to be augmented to find set_order's new location
		in trillium/lib/nreq.
>>><<<

03/16/88	libf77/nreq/TSEND.c
		This routine was simply never converted to Fortran glue code.

03/16/88	libf77/nreq/TRECV.c
		Removed an extraneous comment.

03/16/88	libf77/nreq/DSEND.c
		Removed an unneeded parameter.

03/16/88	libf77/nreq/TWRITE.c
		Changed tprintf to TPRINT.

03/16/88	terror.c
		It was converted to use write instead of fprintf, thus
		eliminating the need to use the standard I/O library.
		This was of particular importance ITB.

03/21/88	libf77/kreq/KEXIT.c, libf77/kreq/Makefile
		Added KEXIT to the Fortran library, which is the equivalent
		of _kexit in C.

03/25/88	libf77/gen/exit.c
		Made this routine the equivalent of _exit in C.

03/27/88	NET.h
		Corrected NOBUF and added SYSINC.

03/27/88	libf77/Makefile, libf77/t4
		Added the transputer access routines SETPRI() and LDTIMER(),
		thus starting the f77 equivalent of libc/t4.

03/27/88	libf77/unix/Makefile, libf77/unix/ERRNO.c
		Added f77 access to the global error variable errno.

03/28/88	libf77/gen/Makefile, libf77/gen
		Added ITOA() and GCVT().

03/28/88	lib/h/trillium
		Added FILE.h

03/29/88	sboot/main.c
		The -n option was previously ignored.  It will now override
		the nodeid in the configuration file.

03/29/88	TWRITE.c
		Rewrote TPRINT() to accept a FORTRAN `character string'
		rather than a simple pointer.  The string as given from
		FORTRAN is copied with editing (\n, \t, \7 and \0 are
		converted to the obvious), then passed to tprint().
		A null is appended at the end if there is no explicit '\0'.

03/29/88	ITOA.c
		Rewrote to accept a FORTRAN `character string'
		rather than a simple pointer.

03/29/88	GCVT.c
		Rewrote GCVT() and FTOA() to accept a FORTRAN
		`character string' rather than a simple pointer.

03/29/88	tbn/
		A new tbn has been received from the Penguin featuring
		major performance gains.

03/31/88	TOPEN.c and TCREAT.c
		The pathname argument is now a FORTRAN
		`character string' rather than a simple pointer.
		A copy of the string is made and a null char is appended.

03/31/88	FILE.h
		Added O_APPEND.

03/31/88	introf.tblms
		Added the Fortran tutorial to the documentation series.

>>>Lboot and vboot now feature frozen booting.<<<

04/01/88	bootreq.h
		Two more fields were added to struct bootreq to hold
		frozen tag and length.

04/01/88	vboot/
		Vboot now understands the z option.  A further option
		e is the equivalent of fz in sboot and specifies the
		name of the frozen file.  Fastboot option f can be used in 
		conjunction with z on vector boards only.

04/01/88	bootd/
		Bootd has two new requests to support frozen booting.
		The module frozen.c was added.  Other modules were
		reorganized between files to consolidate data structures.

04/01/88	confs/L/Makefile, confs/V/Makefile
		A frozen configuration file will now be created as part
		of make install.

04/01/88	lboot
		Added the extra option 'e' to support frozen booting.

04/01/88	confs/L/Makefile, confs/V/Makefile
		Eliminated the condition for creating a frozen configuration
		file.
>>><<<

04/01/88	sboot/main.c
		When certain flags are set eliminating the need for certain
		devices and files, their existance is not checked.

04/01/88	install.tr
		A couple of installation experiences have contributed to
		a new revision of the installation notes.

04/15/88	pcreate.c
		The contents of the BSS segment will now be initialized to zero.

>>>Problems found at NiCHE<<<

04/18/88	doom.c
		A null pointer was being indirected.  This is bad news
		on some machines.

04/27/88	lib/trillium/terror.c
		Changed _atoi to my_atoi and expanded sbuf to 16 bytes.

04/28/88	boot/moses/*/Makefile tools/qlt/boot/moses/Makefile
		Changed cc -E to the more portable /lib/cpp -P.

04/25/88	RDIST
		The obsolete remote distribution directory was removed.

04/26/88	*
		All of the obsolete tty compatible programs were removed.

04/28/88	lib/h/trillium/maconfig.h
		Moved maconfig.h from the mallocd directory to the general
		trillium header directory.

04/30/88	sboot/doargs.c, qboot, tools/qlt/Makefile, tools/bin/Makefile
		Changed qexport to export.

>>><<<

04/18/88	LOC.c
		Added to libf77/gen:  PEEK/POKE stuff

04/18/88	IOR.c
		Added to libf77/gen:  bitwise logical ops

04/18/88	STT.c, STOP.c  (libf77/gen)
		- calls to exit() replaced with _kexit()

04/20/88	RVALLOC.c
		Added to libf77/gen:  wrappers for MALLOC, FREE,
		RMALLOC, RFREE, VALLOC, RVALLOC

04/20/88	ARG.c
		Added to libf77/gen:  utility to pass arguments
		from one fortran function to another BY VALUE.
		Allows practical use of the pointers returned
		by MALLOC.

04/20/88	IOR.c
		Added IEOR (same as IXOR) and ISHFT(a,n) (same as
		ISHFTL(a,n) for n>0, same as ISHFTR(a,-n) for n<0).
		This is to be more compatible with FPS literature.

04/20/88	libc/h/fps/mldefs.f
		Added the FPS file for FORTRAN use of the VPU
		(this is a FORTRAN source file, NOT #defines!)

04/20/88	libc/h/fps/MLDEFS.h
		Added an include file for FORTRAN use of the VPU via
		cpp and the Generic FPS Math Library functions.
		Also includes #defines for ANYBANK, BANKA0, etc since
		we do not have a FORTRAN version of <fps/vecbrd.h>.

04/25/88	libf77/unix
		Added BCOPY.c: a FORTRAN wrapper to access bcopy().

04/25/88	man/
		man pages added: BCOPY, LDTIMER, SETPRI

04/28/88	h/*/Makefile
		Made depend less verbose.

04/28/88	libc/Makefile
		Eliminated redundancy from make depend.

04/28/88	libc/h/fps/Makefile
		Added support for .f files.

04/28/88	libf77/gen/ARG.c
		ARG() renamed FUNARGS(), SUBARGS() added to support
		calling FORTRAN subroutines (not just functions)
		passing some parameters by value.

05/06/88	/doc
		New versions of introc, introf, refc, refu
		with system-specific details isolated in appendices,
		reff.tblms added.

05/17/88	libc/gen/itoa.c
		Expanded sbuf to 16 bytes.

05/19/88	kenyad/pcreate.c
		Do not use argv tag if argc is 0.

05/24/88	loadd.c
		Fixed loadd file descriptors to close on error.

05/24/88	libstdio/kexit.c
		Removed call to pdetach.

05/24/88	libstdio/Makefile
		Added a missing default BASE macro.

05/25/88	rmread() and rmwrite() are macros in <trillium/memreq.h>
		and the parameter order is always (node, src, dest, nbytes)
		- corrected in rmwrite.l

05/25/88	libf77/RMWRITE.c
		New file: wrappers for rmread() and rmwrite().

06/01/88	ulsmch/*-trillium
		Added libm to the default Fortran library list.

06/01/88	doc/overview.tr
		an updated, glossier version

06/01/88	kenyad.c
		Removed redundant (with nreq) set_order function.

06/01/88	rloadgo.c, bloadgo.c
		Used different flat tags for argv structure and load module.

06/01/88	libstdio/_doprnt.c
		isinf() and isnan() had the word ordering inside a
		'double' wrong for the transputer.  They should also
		be enclosed in an "#if FLOAT / #endif" pair.

>>>Various revisions with respect to the loadgo functionality.<<<

06/01/88	rflat.c, bflat.c
		Updated to use new stateless protocol with flatd.

06/01/88	flatd.c
		Rewrote FL_LOAD request to spawn a separate process which
		receives data messages in any order.
		Added FL_DONE request to clean up after worker process.

06/01/88	flatreq.h
		Added FL_DONE.

06/01/88	kenyad/pdetach.c
		Wait until the client is dead before releasing its memory.

>>><<<

06/01/88	kenyad.c
		Removed the redundant (with nreq) stub function.

06/04/88	fish.tty
		Deleted one remaining trace of tty days.  Fish is
		now a stub on goulds and suns.

06/05/88	sboot.tty
		Deleted some more tty debris from the sun and gould
		object directories.
