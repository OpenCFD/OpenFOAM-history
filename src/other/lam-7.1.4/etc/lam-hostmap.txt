#
# This file is for re-mapping IP hostnames/addresses to be used for
# MPI communications.  Specifically, if a host is listed here and is
# used in the LAM universe, the MPI SSI modules will use the remapped
# address for all of its direct MPI communication.
#
# A common example of where this is useful is when you want to lamboot
# over a "slow" TCP network but have your MPI communications go across
# a different, "fast" TCP network.  You would list your slow IP
# names/addresses here and remap them to the fast names/addresses.
# The LAM MPI SSI modules will automatically remap from the "slow" to
# "fast" addresses whenever they create new connections for MPI-based
# communications.
#
# Note that lamd-based communication (i.e., LAM run-time environment
# native/out-of-band communication) will still use the original
# addresses.  Hence, the "lamd" rpi module will still use the original
# addresses -- not the remapped addreses.
#
# Example entries:
#
# node1.slow.example.com mpi=node1.fast.example.com
# node2.slow.example.com mpi=node2.fast.example.com
#
# The "fast" entries should be listed under the "mpi" key.
