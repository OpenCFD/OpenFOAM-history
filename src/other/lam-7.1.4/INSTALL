Installation Instructions for LAM/MPI
=====================================

Instructions for installing LAM/MPI have been moved from this file to
the LAM/MPI Installation Guide, available as a PDF document in the
doc/ directory of the LAM/MPI source distribution.  The document is
also available in PDF and PS form on the LAM/MPI web page:

		       http://www.lam-mpi.org/

A LAM/MPI User's Guide is also available from the same location, which
provides a good reference for both new users to LAM and those wishing
to exploit new features of LAM/MPI 7.1.4.


The Quick Overview
------------------

If you don't want to read the Installation Guide, the following should
do the trick for most situations:

     % gunzip -c lam-7.1.4.tar.gz | tar xf -
     % cd lam-7.1.4
     % ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/in
     [...lots of output...]
     % make
     [...lots of output...]
     % make install
     [...lots of output...]

     # Ensure that $prefix/bin is in in your $path so that LAM's
     # newly-created "mpicc" can be found

     % make examples   # This step is optional
     [...lots of output...]

If you do not specify a prefix, LAM will first look for "lamclean" in
your path.  If lamclean is found, it will use the parent of the
directory where lamclean is located as the prefix.  Otherwise,
/usr/local is used (like most GNU software).
