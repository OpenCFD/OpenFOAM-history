 * This file is not included anywhere in LAM; the real version number
 * is in VERSION in the top-level LAM source tree (which gets
 * substituted into lam_config.h -- part of <mpi.h>).  However, some
 * 3rd party MPI tools have come to rely on it to obtain the version
 * number in various configuration scripts.  So we'll leave it here.
 * It's ok to AC_OUTPUT this file from configure since we don't
 * include it anywhere -- no dependencies will get whacked because no
 * one includes this file.
