-*-boot:no-prefix-*-
# This is invoked when lambooting in Globus environment, when the
# hostfile does not contain the prefix for a specific node
# %1 = name of the invoking program
# %2 = name of the hostfile/boot schema
# %3 = name of the corresponding host
It seems you have not specified the 'prefix' for host '%3' in hostfile
'%2'.
You need to specify prefix=<lam_install_dir> where <lam_install_dir> is the
complete path where LAM/MPI is installed on this host.
-*-boot:remote-boot-fail-globus-*-
# This is invoked when globus inetexec fails in lambootagent.c.  It is only
# for the case where a remote lamd failed to launch, specifically when
# we tried to execute some LAM binary.
# %1 = remote hostname/username
# %2 = local globusrun attempted to be executed
# %3 = remote shell
# %4 = sample command to execute
LAM failed to execute a LAM binary on the remote node "%1".
LAM attempted to execute a process on the remote node "%1",
but received some output on the standard error.

LAM tried to use the command "%2" to invoke the following command:

        %4

The problem may be because:

    -  The Globus GRAM client returned some output on the stderr

    -  You have not done 'grid-proxy-init'. You need to do that before
       LAM can boot as it uses globus-job-run to start the LAM daemons.

    -  LAM is not able to find binaries in the 'prefix' path you 
       specified in the boot hostfile. Check the path, it should point to 
       the directory where LAM/MPI is installed on this host.

Try to invoke the command listed above manually at a Unix prompt.
When you can get this command to execute successfully by hand, LAM
will probably be able to function properly.
-*-boot:no-lamgrow-*-
# This is invoked when lamgrow is called
LAM currently does not support "lamgrow" in Globus environment.
