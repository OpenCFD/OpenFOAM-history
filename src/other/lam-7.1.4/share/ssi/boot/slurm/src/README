To-do:

- when a SLURM job is killed, it doesn't seem to kill the lamd's
  "nicely" -- resources are left around (e.g., the session directory).
  Have question pending to the SLURM guys asking what signal is used.

- Test situations with CPU count > 1 (might only be able to do this on
  LLNL machines).
