# ASCII help messages for LAM
#
-*-parse-options:lamgrow-makes-no-sense-*-
# Called when lamgrow is invoked with the slurm module
# No parameters are passed
Invoking "lamgrow" in a batch environment such as SLRUM currently does
not make any sense -- LAM only has the nodes that SLURM has allocated,
and therefore cannot grow the LAM universe.

Aborting.
-*-env-var:not-found-*-
# Called when an expected environment variable was not found
# %1: name of the environment variable
The environment variable "%1" was not found.

LAM is likely to abort.
-*-env-var:bad-value-*-
# Called when an environment variable has an unexpected or otherwise
# "bad" value
# %1: name of the environment variable
# %2: value of the environment variable
The environment variable "%1" had a bad or unexpected value:

  %2

LAM was unable to parse this value, and is likely to abort.
-*-process:bad-exit-*-
# Called when srun exits badly
The srun process unexpectedly exited badly (i.e., with a non-zero
status or was signalled).  

This is not a good sign; LAM is going to abort because something else
is probably wrong.
-*-hostname:too-long-*-
# Called when the hostname is too long
# %1: the name that is too long
The hostname "%1" is too long.

LAM needs a shorter hostname; sorry.
