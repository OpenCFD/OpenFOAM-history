-*-rpi-gm:gm-dma-malloc-fail-*-
# Called in the gm RPI when it cannot allocate enough dynamic memory
# %1 = failing rank
# %2 = how much it tried to allocate
It seems that rank %1 was not able to allocate additional
DMA-accessible memory for Myrinet. DMA-accessible memory is memory
which the Myrinet cards can access. Typically, OS's have fixed limits
on how the total amount of DMA memory can be allocated at one
time. Long MPI messages require that a large amount of DMA-accessible
memory be allocated. If possible, try using smaller messages or
adjusting the OS's DMA limit. :-(

GM failed to allocate a DMA block of %2 bytes.
-*-rpi-gm:couldnt-get-port-*-
# Called when we couldn't get a GM port.
LAM was not able to obtain a GM port.  This typically means:

    - All the ports on this machine are being used
    - A failure occured on an opened port

You may wish to run the gm_board_info program that comes with
Myricom's GM distribution to check the status of the local myrinet
board.
-*-rpi-gm:failed-to-init-*-
# Called them the ssi_rpi_gm_gm_setup() fails
LAM was not able to intialize its gm module properly (although it
was able to obtain a gm port).  This should not normally happen.
Typical causes include:

    - Other gm processes using all available DMA memory
    - Other gm processes using all available send/receive gm tokens 

You may wish to run the gm_board_info program that comes with
Myricom's GM distribution to check the status of the local myrinet
board.
