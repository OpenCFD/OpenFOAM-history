.SH NOTES

This function is deprecated.  It has been replaced with an MPI-2
function (see the "See also" section, below), which provides the same
functionality.  This function is (or effectively is) a wrapper to the
replacement function, anyway.  User programs should use the MPI-2
replacement function instead of this function.

Some functions are deprecated because their names did not conform to
the stricter naming conventions of MPI-2; others are deprecated
because they have been replaced with more flexible functionality.

documents contain detailed information about each MPI function (most
of which is not duplicated in these man pages).
