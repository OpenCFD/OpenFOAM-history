.SH NOTES

This function is deprecated.  It has been replaced with an MPI-2
function (see the "See also" section, below), which provides the same
functionality.  This function is (or effectively is) a wrapper to the
replacement function, anyway.  User programs should use the MPI-2
replacement function instead of this function.

Some functions are deprecated because their names did not conform to
the stricter naming conventions of MPI-2; others are deprecated
because they have been replaced with more flexible functionality.

For more information, please see the official MPI Forum web site,
which contains the text of both the MPI-1 and MPI-2 standards.  These
documents contain detailed information about each MPI function (most
of which is not duplicated in these man pages).
