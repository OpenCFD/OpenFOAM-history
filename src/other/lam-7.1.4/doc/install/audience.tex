\chapter{Who Should Read This Document?}
\label{sec:audience}

This document is intended for people who need to configure, compile,
and install LAM/MPI.  Although the document is quite lengthy, most
users will be able to get LAM up and running with minimal effort (and
minimal reading).  A quick-install chapter (Chapter~\ref{sec:quick},
page~\pageref{sec:quick}) is available for the impatient, although we
recommend reading at least the Release Notes
(Chapter~\ref{sec:releasenotes}, page~\pageref{sec:releasenotes}) and
browsing the available configure options (Chapter~\ref{sec:configure},
page~\pageref{sec:configure}).

If you are a user of LAM with no intention of ever building LAM
yourself, this isn't the document for you.  You should be reading the
LAM/MPI User's Guide~\cite{lamteam03:_lam_mpi_user_guide} for
detailed information on how to use LAM/MPI.
