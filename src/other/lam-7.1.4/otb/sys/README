$HEADER$



This directory contains the source for the lamd.  Each of the
subdirectories is one of the pseudo-daemons within the lamd.

There are two ways to run the "lam daemon" - as a bunch of seperate
processes (easy debugging) or as one process (the lamd).  Each
directory contains a file containing main() used for the first case.
The lamd directory contains the main() for the all-in-one option.
