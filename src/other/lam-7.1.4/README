Where to go from here?
----------------------

Starting with LAM/MPI 7.0, documentation on LAM is available via two
documents: an Installation Guide and a User's Guide.  Both are
available in the source distribution of LAM/MPI as PDF documents and
on the LAM web site as both PDF and PostScript documents.

We recommend anyone building and installing LAM read the Installation
Guide.  In addition to documenting the many features of LAM/MPI, it
includes the latest release notes for LAM/MPI 7.1.4.

Users are encouraged to read the User's Guide, which includes
documentation on new features of LAM, as well as detailed reference
for all LAM/MPI programs.


I have a question/problem.  What do I do?
-----------------------------------------

The Installation Guide provides information and troubleshooting tips
regarding the installation of LAM/MPI.  For user application problems,
please see the User's Guide.  Both provide a number of frequently asked
questions and information on reporting bugs or problems with LAM/MPI.
