MICO programs as NT services
by Sorin Mustaca - sorin.mustaca@ravantivirus.com

This is free source and it is distributed in the same way as MICO ... 

Purpose:
	This is a generic wrapper that 
	installs
	uninstalls
	starts
	stops
	restarts
	run
a NT service.
	
	Call micoservice.exe with these arguments:
	<service name> -i <configuration file>  to install a service.
		It will write the in the registry the configuration file
		The Display name (what you see in Services) of the service 
		will be "MICO Service("+Service Name+")".
		The Service Name will be <Service Name>
	<service name> -u   to uninstall a service
	<service name> --start,--stop,--restart   - no explanation needed
	<service name> --run  - to run the MICO program as if it were a console application,not NT Service
	It will read the configuration specified upon installation  
	and read the command line specified in that file.
	I prefered the file and not registry because it is easier to work with.
	

Build:
	Just call nmake.exe
Install:
	See example of Naming Service installation
	See GInstall.bat and GUninstall.bat for a generic installation and uninstallation

Platforms supported:
	Of course, only Windows :)))
	Any NT, 2000, XP
	See that you have ws2_32.dll somewhere in the path.

Tested on:
	XP Professional - all patches
	2000 Server SP1
	2000 Professional SP1
	NT Server 4.0 - SP6a
