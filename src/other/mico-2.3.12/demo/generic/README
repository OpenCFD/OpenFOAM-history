The files in this directory show the implementation of a generic
client and server. Once the executables are build, the test interface
and actual parameters are determined at runtime. The test interface is
defined in "test.idl" and the test cases to be executed in
"test_cases".  First edit test.idl and test_cases to your liking. Then
use the shell script "run_test" to execute the demo. The sources only
use CORBA functionality. The code should be portable to any other
compliant C++ ORB.
