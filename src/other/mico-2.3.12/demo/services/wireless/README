The wCORBA project testing systems

This directory contains the programs used to test the Wireless CORBA
implementation MIWCO in the wCORBA project.  Descriptions of each are
found below.  Scripts for starting the various MIWCO applications are
in the frame directory, which contains its own README file.

hello:
	A simple Hello-world-type application.  The client invokes two
	operations, the first of which requires a line of input on the
	server, and the second of which throws an exception.

dublin:
	A simple time server system.  The server waits for a specified
	time before returning the current time.  This was used as a
	demo system at the Dublin OMG meeting in November 2001 (with
	Combat-based graphical clients).

frame:
	A scriptable version of the dublin system.  Further
	documentation is in its own README.
