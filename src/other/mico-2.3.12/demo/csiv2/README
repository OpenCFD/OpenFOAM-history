This directory contains various CSIv2 demos. All demos are simple
Hello World CORBA app which uses various aspect of CSIv2
implementation. Every demo can be compiled by 'make' command and
executed by provided 'hello' script except interoperability tests
which are located in interop directory.

hello-1:
uses GSSUP authentication over plain IIOP (without SSL/TLS)

tls-hello-1:
similar to hello-1 demo but runs over SSL/TLS protected IIOP
connection

tls-hello-2:
demonstrates SSL/TLS based client (without CSIv2 support)
authentication to CSIv2 server. Server can authenticate client by
using information obtained from TLS layer

identity-1:
uses and demonstrates identity assertion in attribute layer of SAS
protocol

tls-identity-1:
similar to identity-1 demo, but uses SSL/TLS transport layer and
doesn't use authentication layer. Asserted identity is verified on the
basis of information obtained from transport layer

interop:
demonstrates MICO CSIv2 interoperability against various vendors
products
