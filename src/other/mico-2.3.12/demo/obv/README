Some demos for Objects by Value.

date:
	A quite simple example introducing a "date" valuetype that
	packages date, month and year values.

tree:
	A more complex example that builds a binary tree from abstract
	valuetypes: keys are abstract types that support an equality
	and a comparison operator, while nodes have a common abstract
	base.

abstract:
	Demonstrates the usage of abstract interfaces, which can be
	implemented both by a valuetype or a concrete interface. See
	abstract/README.

custom:
	Demonstrates custom marshalling; a "custom" valuetype can provide
	its own marshalling and unmarshalling methods to allow for a more
	compressed or specific representation.

tricky:
	Demonstrates some tricky special cases of valuetype usage
	(parameter sharing, cyclic graphs, "skipped" values).
