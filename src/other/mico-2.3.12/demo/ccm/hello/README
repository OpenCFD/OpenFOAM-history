This is a simple "Hello World" component.

The Hello World component supports the Hello interface, which has a single
method to elicit a message from the server. The component has an attribute
that allows setting of that message.

The HelloHome also does not do anything fancy.

The client creates an instance of the HelloWorld component, via the home
interface, configures the message to "Hello World", and then calls sayHello.

This one builds the component into a standalone server.
