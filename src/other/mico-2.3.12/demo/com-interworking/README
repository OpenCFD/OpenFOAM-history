
Usage:
	idl --codegen-midl <file.idl>

This generates a <file.midl> that is the translation of the
input file.

Example:
	idl --no-codegen-c++ --codegen-midl account.idl

This generates the file:
	account.midl

If you use Windows95/98/NT the GUIDS are automatically generated.
If you use another S.O. instead of GUIDS, it generates a sequence
of XXX.. that you must replace with GUIDS manually.

SOME CORBA IDL TYPES ARE NOT TRANSLATED, i.e:
	any
	exceptions
	Native
	Value
	ValueBox
	ValueMember
	TypeCode
	etc.

The use of these types causes error when compiling with midl.

This directory contains an example of the interworking:
	clientCOM   ->   serverCOM   ->   server (CORBA)
          (EXE)            (EXE)             (DLL)

Build it with "nmake /f Makefile.win32".

Check the macro SRCDIR to point to your correct path to mico diretcory.
It is supposed that the win32-bin directory is a subdirectory of mico.
If it is not, change the macro WIN32_BIN to point to win32-bin directory.

Register severCOM with "serverCOM /REGSERVER".

Use the batch file "example" to start the example.
