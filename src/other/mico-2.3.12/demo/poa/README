CORBA 2.2 specification, and how to implement POA-based servants.

	Shows various ways how to implement inheritance.

account-1:
	A Bank object (factory) creates account objects.

account-2:
	Demonstrates the usage of a ServantManager. The Bank creates
	references to "virtual" objects, which are then incarnated
	on request.

	are "etherealized" -- their state is written to disk. See also
	account-3/README.
