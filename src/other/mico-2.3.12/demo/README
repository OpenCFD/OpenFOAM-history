To compile any of the examples you should copy this directory to your home
directory, change into one of the demo directories and type make:
	cp -r INSTDIR/doc/mico/examples ~/
	cd ~/examples/account
	gmake
where INSTDIR is the direcory MICO was installed in. If gmake cannot find 
mico-c++, mico-ld, or idl you should source the mico-setup script to setup
paths. If your shell is one of csh,tcsh type:
	source INSTDIR/lib/mico-setup.csh
If your shell is one of sh,ash,bash,ksh,zsh type:
	. INSTDIR/lib/mico-setup.sh
