Some example which ilustrate usage of MT stuff.

callback: Trivial callback hello world like application. Client starts
          new thread for orb and then enters infinite loop (in which we can do whichever
          we (or client) want). Server creates new thread for sending requests to the client
	  and starts it.

prodcons-1: Producer/consumer demo which uses mutex, condition variable and threads
            from MICO/MT library.
