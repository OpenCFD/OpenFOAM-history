This is an implementation of a MICO Dispatcher using the GTK main
loop. It should be pretty much complete and correct - the only thing
that isn't implemented is the move() operation. (i.e., changing to
another dispatcher). It wouldn't be that hard to do, but it is hard to
imagine a case where it would be useful. (The Xaw and Qt Dispatchers
don't implement it either).

The code here is extensively based on the Xaw Dispatcher in the
MICO distribution. See client.cc and server.cc for examples of
the (very simple) usage.
