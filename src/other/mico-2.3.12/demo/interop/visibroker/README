Interoperability test with VisiBroker Developer for Java 3.1
============================================================

- make sure you have set the VisiBroker environment variables
  properly (e.g. by sourcing vbroker.sh) and osagent is
  running
- do "make" in this directory
- run server object "account_svr". Server will write its IOR
  to a file called "account.ref"
- run Java client with "vbj Client"
- Client should print "The balance is 450"
- to run the applet version, run "run_applet". The "Current
  balance" field should display the current balance of the
  account server object (450 in this case)
- or you can just run the shell script account...
