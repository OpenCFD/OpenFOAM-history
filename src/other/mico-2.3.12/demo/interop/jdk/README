Interoperability test with JDK 1.3
==================================

As of version 1.3 of Sun's JDK, a basic ORB implementation is part of
the JDK distribution. This README explains how to make JDK1.3 and MICO
interoperate. The setup is the same as for the VisiBroker
interoperability test.

- install JDK 1.3.
- do "make" in this directory
- run server object "account_svr". Server will write its IOR
  to a file called "account.ref"
- run Java client with "java Client"
- Client should print "The balance is 450"
- to run the applet version, run "run_applet". The "Current
  balance" field should display the current balance of the
  account server object (450 in this case)
- or you can just run the shell script account...

Note that the demo programs contained in this directory are identical
with the ones in ../visibroker except for some deprectated features
that had to be changed in the Java implementation.

Also note that the graphical IR browser that is shipped with MICO in
mico/tools/ir-browser requires JDK 1.1.5
