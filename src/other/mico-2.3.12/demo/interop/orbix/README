Interoperability test with Orbix 2.1c
=====================================

The files in this directory demonstrate the interoperability between
Orbix version 2.1c and MICO. Follow the instructions in the Orbix
documentation to run a persistent grid server object. The files are
located in corba2/demo/grid_iiop in the Orbix distribution. Start the
Orbix demo and keep the persistent grid server running.

After typing "make" in this directory you should get a corresponding
MICO client for the grid example called "grid_client". Run it to
connect to the Orbix persistent server. Note that the MICO client must
have access to a file called /tmp/gridiiop.ref where the persistent
Orbix server stores its IOR.
