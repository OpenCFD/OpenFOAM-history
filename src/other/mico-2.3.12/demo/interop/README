Here we demonstrate the interoperability between MICO and some
commercial ORBs via IIOP. Each sub-directory contains a little README
which tells how to run the demo. Beware that we have tested
interoperability with a specific version of each ORB. The demo might
not work with newer releases of these ORBs.

orbix     : Interoperability test with Orbix 2.1c
visibroker: Interoperability test with VisiBroker Developer for Java 3.1
jdk       : Interoperability test with JDK 1.3
