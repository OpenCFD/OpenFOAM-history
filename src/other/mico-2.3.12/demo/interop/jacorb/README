Interoperability test Mico and Jacorb
Copyright Thomas Fricke 1998
============================================================

This example has been derived from both the simple Jacorb 
example1 and the Mico demo/account2 to demonstrate the 
interoperation of Mico and Jacorb.

============================================================

With this example it is possible to demonstrate interoperation 
between both the most complete free Corba implementations, 
Mico and Jacorb.

You will need both jacorb and mico. The demo hast been tested with
jacorb 0.9e and mico 2.1.1. The example will not work using
Mico 2.0.0 ! Edit the Makefile and replace the variables
by the appropriate values of your installation.

============================================================

To install this example:

- place this directory in mico/demo/interop

- make sure you have set both the Mico and Jacorb environment 
  variables properly (e.g. by sourcing mico/.../mico-setup.csh
  and JacORB_0.9e/setenv.csh 

- do "make" in this directory

- run the account script

Output should be the same as in account.out, except the 
IP numbers and the port.

============================================================

Notice the line in account

./client  -ORBNoCodeSets `cat account.ref`

which connects the Corba 2.1 compliant Mico 2.1.1 with the 2.0
compliant Jacorb. This means that the mico client does not
generate characterset information, which is not understood by
some 2.0 servers, including jacorb 0.9e.

The run_applet (the same as in the visibroker example) should
work the same way as described there, both with a Java or
C++ server.

============================================================

Thanks to Gerald Brose and Kay Roemer (and the whole Mico Team) 
for the support and bringing the stuff to the net!
