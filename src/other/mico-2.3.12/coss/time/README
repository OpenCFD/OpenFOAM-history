This is the first release off an COSS TimeService according to the base
specifications of the OMG. 

Curently only TimeBase and CosTime is covered, there is no TimeEvent available.
It is unlikly that I will add them, if you feel the need you are welcome.

For additional information look at the doc directory and the sources.

To compile go to src and invoke make, the implementation has only been
tested with mico2.2.7 on Linux/Intel.
