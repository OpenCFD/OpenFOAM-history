This directory contains an interface repository browser with
capabilities to invoke methods on the browsed interfaces. The browser
gui is written in java, so a gateway is needed to connect the C++ ORB
to java. This gateway is called "diiproxy". This gateway will be
replaced in a future version with Java's ORB implementation.

The shellscript "runproxy" will run "diiproxy" and the IR server. The
IR server is then fed with some idl's so you have something to browse.
The browser can then be run by "appletviewer dii.html" or by loading
the file dii.html into your java-aware WebBrowser.
