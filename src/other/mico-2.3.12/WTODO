TODO list for the Wireless CORBA implementation


* Fix incompatibility with multi-threading

  Last time it was tried, enabling thread use causes the Wireless
  CORBA bridges to crash, possibly when they receive an invocation to
  the local bridge object.  This might be caused by the bridge using
  its own IIOPServer object.  Fixing this issue should be done as soon
  as possible.

* Modernize the GTP implementation

  The GTP implementation was originally copied from the GIOP
  implementation.  Now the GIOP implementation has seen a lot of
  change and it would make sense to keep the GTP implementation in
  sync with the GIOP one, since that would, e.g., make it more proof
  against possible future changes in MICO.

  Since the two protocols are pretty much the same in terms of their
  requirements and design, it might be best to separate all common
  code into an IOPConn class that is then used by the individual
  protocol implementations.

* Add multi-threading capability to bridges where sensible

  The Wireless CORBA bridges have been designed so that
  multi-threading in them helps very little, as there is no
  possibility for message processing to be delayed indefinitely.

  However, it might be sensible to have different terminal bridges
  served by different threads at the access bridge.  Also, completing
  some Wireless CORBA procedures requires networking, and it might be
  useful if things that were not affected could proceed regardless.

* Make sure the Bluetooth protocol works

  The LTP protocol over Bluetooth has been tested in the MIWCO-LTP
  implementation, which was based on MICO 2.3.6, but to my knowledge,
  no one has tested the new implementation properly.

  Also, much of the protocol implementation is copied from existing
  transport implementations.  Since these have changed drastically, it
  would be useful to re-copy the implementation.  This might also help
  it to work better.
