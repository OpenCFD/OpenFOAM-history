- remove remaining asserts() and throw exceptions instead
- CORBA::Status should be void
- add right arithmetic operators for fixed type
- _tc_* constants for system exceptions are missing
- Avoid array assignments in generated code, because this does not work
  for C++ compilers != GNU C++.
- make a toplevel make-target "check" that runs tests in all
  sub-directories. It would be nice to have a uniform way of
  running the tests/demo. The shell scripts in each directory
  are called differently.
- re-structure C++ backend of IDL compiler: it would make sense
  to introduce a class for each IDL type that generates code
  for that type.
- GIOP 1.2
- make C++ mapping of exceptions compliant
- Standard exception minor codes
- DynValue
- orb.idl
