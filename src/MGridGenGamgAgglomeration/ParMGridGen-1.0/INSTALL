THE SERIAL LIBRARY MGRIDGEN
---------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

MGRIDGEN is a software package for generating coarse grids.
The documentation of MGRIDGEN can be found in the Doc/manual-parmgridgen.ps file.

MGRIDGEN is written in ANSI C and should compile on Unix systems that have
a ANSI C compiler. It has been extensively tested on the following
architectures:

   AIX
   SunOS 
   Solaris
   IRIX 
   Unicos
   Linux
   FreeBSD


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

In order to build MGRIDGEN you need
  (a) a C compiler that is ANSI compatible 
  (b) make 

Edit the file Makefile.in that resides in the same directory as this file 
according to the requirements of your system. In particular you may need
to modify the following:
  1. The executable for GNU make (gmake)
  2. The CC and LD variables, to be the name of the ANSI C compiler 
     in your system. The GNU C compiler (gcc) will do. 
  3. The settings for the AR and RANLIB variables that are suitable for
     you system. Note that some systems do not have 'ranlib' but they use
     'ar -ts' instead, or it is not needed all together. 
  4. You can use COPTIONS and LDOPTIONS to provide additional command line
     options that are required by your compiler and linker.


After saving the modified Makefile.in, type 'make' at the prompt. This will
build MGRIDGEN's library, and a program that tests the algorithm.
Upon successful completion, make creates the following files:

  MGridGen/IMlib/libIMlib.a
  libmgrid.a
  mgridgen

Please read the instructions in the file Graphs/README on how to go and
test the various programs.

The header file mgridgen.h can be used to provide the prototype for the
main routine in MGRIDGEN.

THE PARALLEL LIBRARY PARMGRIDGEN
--------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

PARMGRIDGEN is a parallel software package for generating coarse grids.
The documentation of PARMGRIDGEN can be found in the Doc/manual-parmgridgen.ps
file.

PARMGRIDGEN  is written in ANSI C, using Message Passing Interface (MPI)
for communication between the processors, and should compile on Unix systems
that have a ANSI C compiler and an installation of MPI. It has been extensively
tested on the following architectures:

   AIX
   IRIX
   Unicos
   Linux


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

In order to build PARMGRIDGEN you need
  (a) an MPI C compiler
  (b) make

Edit the file Makefile.in that resides in the same directory as this file
according to the requirements of your system. In particular you may need
to modify the following:
  1. The executable for GNU make (gmake)
  2. The CC and LD variables, to be the name of the ANSI C compiler 
     in your system. The GNU C compiler (gcc) will do. 
  3. The PARCC and PARLD variables, to be the name of the compiler in
     your system. The default is to use mpicc from MPICH. 
  4. The settings for the AR and RANLIB variables that are suitable for
     you system. Note that some systems do not have 'ranlib' but they use
     'ar -ts' instead, or it is not needed all together.
  5. You can use COPTIONS and LDOPTIONS to provide additional command line
     options that are required by your compiler and linker.


After saving the modified Makefile.in, type 'make parallel' at the prompt. This
will build PARMGRIDGEN's library, and a program that tests the algorithm.
Upon successful completion, make creates the following files:

  ParMGridGen/IMParMetis-2.0/libIMparmetis.a
  libparmgrid.a
  parmgridgen

Please read the instructions in the file Graphs/README on how to go and
test the various programs.

The header file parmgridgen.h can be used to provide the prototype for the
main routine in PARMGRIDGEN.

    NOTE-1: The results on your machine will most likely look different
            because of differences in the random number generators.
            Look if the test programs reports any 'incorrect' results.
            If the test goes through correctly, then you have compiled
            PARMGRIDGEN successfully!

    NOTE-2: FYI, the header files mgridgen.h and parmgridgen.h contain
            definitions for the datatypes to be used for integer and real
            arithmetic. If you wish to switch to short (for integer) or
            float (for real) you need to edit the files
              o    MGridGen/IMlib/IMlib.h 
              o    ParMGridGen/IMParMetis-2.0/ParMETISLib/struct.h
            and comment the defintion accordigly.
